If you want to write code in JavaScript, then Perl will be the best choice. But if you're writing PHP code, and don't care about performance, then either language should do fine. Both are great languages for web development. The only difference between them that matters is how fast they compile your code. In my experience, both have good performance when it comes to compiling large codebases. Which one would you rather use? This question has been asked before on this site, so I'll answer it. For me, I'd go with Perl. It's fast, compiles quickly, and supports many different languages. It also allows me to use any programming language, including PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. However, there was an interesting article by Dave Thomas recently where he said that while Ruby does not support all languages, Python does. He gave some reasons why Python might be better than Ruby. So let's take a look at what he's saying. 1. Python can run faster because it doesn't need as much memory overhead 
 2.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something more powerful than JavaScript, then Perl might be better suited. But if your goal is just to get some basic functionality out of it, then PHP and Ruby are probably good choices. The main reason why people use both languages in their everyday work is because they have similar strengths and weaknesses. Both can do things very well, but there are differences between them. For example, Java has an excellent JVM (Java’s native runtime), which makes it easy to develop applications with lots of features. However, it’s also quite difficult to make complex programs using it. On top of that, there’s no standard way to write code in Java. This means that most developers who try writing web apps end up making compromises like this: 
 
 They start by creating small simple programs, only one line at a time. Then they add features as needed. And then, when they’re done, they delete them all together.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your web applications. If you’re looking for a language that will help you write more efficient code, then Perl would be the way to go. However, if you’d rather have an easy-to-use language, with powerful features and great documentation, then PHP might just do it for you. In either case, it’s worth considering which one of these languages best fits your needs. For example, I often find myself writing code in Perl, but not because I’m trying to speed up my code. Rather, I’ve found that using Perl makes me feel like I’m doing something productive, even though I’m not. This feeling comes partly from the fact that there are so many tools available to make programming easier, such as perldoc and perldocs. But most importantly, there’s also the joy of being able to express complex ideas concisely. Another benefit of having access to all those tools is that they allow you to focus on solving problems instead of worrying about how long it takes someone else to finish their work.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to write a web application in Perl, then Perl will be an excellent choice. It has many of the same features as JavaScript, but it also offers some unique ones. For example, if you want to build applications for mobile devices, there are several advantages over using HTML and CSS. You can use CSS only when needed, which means fewer resources need to be used by your application. This reduces memory usage, increases performance and, most importantly, allows developers to focus more time on building their applications. In addition, HTML5 provides new capabilities such as offline rendering and media queries. These allow users to enjoy content without having to wait until they get back online. But if you have other goals than writing web applications, then JavaScript might not be the right choice either. The main reason why people choose PHP instead of Java is because it supports server-side rendering, which makes developing websites much easier.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want your application to do. If you’re building a web application, then it’s probably best to use JavaScript. However, if you’re developing an app that needs to be deployed in production, and need something more robust than JS, then Perl might make sense. For example, let’s say we have some code that will run every time someone visits our website. This means we’ll need to build it with Perl. We can do so by using perl -m './myapp.png' --no-reload instead of just running it. The result should look like this: 
 
 $ perl6 my-app.jpg 
 
 As you can see, we’re not only saving time, but also making sure that the file doesn’t get deleted when people visit our site. In addition, since we’re deploying the page locally, we don’t even need to worry about updating any files during deployment. But how does this affect us? Well, for starters, we now have two versions of our application.","The first thing I want to do with this article, and most of the other articles that have been written on it in recent years (and are still being done), was write a simple example. It's not going anywhere because there isn't any real way for me/my team members like myself out there who can actually make use from what we've learned so far without having an actual programming language at all!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying it at. The easiest way to get started with NodeJS and PHP, however, involves using a simple script that will let your code run in the background while running tests (or other tasks). You can also use an external tool like Gulp for testing scripts as well; if there's no such thing as ""no test"" then just write some more lines of Javascript into them so they'll be ready when needed!","I'm not sure what this means. I think it's that the language has a lot of features, and you can use them to make your code more readable (or less confusing). But in practice there are some things which aren't as good for writing simple programs like Javascript/Python; they're just too complex! So if we want our program written with very little effort then maybe one way would be to write something much simpler than an existing programming paradigm such AsyncTask. This might seem obvious but when looking at how many people have tried using async tasks on their own projects these days most developers don´t know about asynchronous workflows either - so why should anyone care?!","The best way to learn about programming languages and how they work together in a single language, I think. The only thing that's not good enough for me right now are the words ""JavaScript"". It sounds like it would be great if you could say something similar but this isn't what we're talking about here so let's just go with one word… Javascript! This term comes from an article written by John Clements of Stony Brook University called Programming Languages & Applications (PML). He writes on his blog at http://www-pmlblogger/javascripts. In addition he has also been writing articles such as How To Learn Java Using Python And Ruby On Rails, which can help beginners understand more advanced concepts while still being able see some interesting things happening behind the scenes using these tools without having any experience coding them yourself – especially when learning new technologies first hand 🙂 So lets get started today!!","This question has been asked many times before, and I've always found it to be a good one. But this time around we're going to take the first step in answering that last part of the puzzle by asking you what makes your language so great! Let's start with some basic definitions for languages like C++ (or any other programming style), Java (JavaScript), Python (Python 2 ), PHP (PHP 3 ), Ruby (Ruby on Rails 4 ), Node.js."

If you want a touch-friendly operating system, then Windows 7 will be your best bet. It has been around for quite some time and it still works well. However, if you prefer something more traditional, like Mac OS X, then Windows 8.1 may work well as an alternative. The main difference between these two OSes is in their user interface. In Windows, there is no desktop environment at all, but instead all applications run inside of one single window. This makes them easier to use than MacOS, which uses multiple windows per application. On top of that, Microsoft offers users many different ways to customize the look and feel of each app. For example, by using its new “Material Design” interface, you can change how elements such as buttons, menus, icons, tabs, etc. look. You also have access to Microsoft’s own custom themes, so you don’t need to go through third-party sites to get them.","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a touch-friendly OS with lots of apps, then the Surface 2 will be your best bet. But if you prefer something more traditional and less user-friendly, then you’ll probably like either version better. In fact, I think both versions have their strengths and weaknesses. For example, while Microsoft has made some great strides in making its apps easier for users to use, it still doesn’t quite get there yet. And although it’s true that many people don’t use all the features available today, they do make up for this by using them frequently. So even though Microsoft may not yet offer every feature we want, they’re certainly working hard at it. As far as hardware goes, there’s no real difference between the two models. Both come with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 32GB storage, microSD card slot, HDMI port, USB 3.0 port and Bluetooth 4.0. They also share similar form factors — 10.1-inch screen size, 13-hour battery life, keyboard cover magnets, etc.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a desktop operating system that will run all your programs and not be bogged down by too many extra features, then Windows 7 might be better for you. But if you have more than one program running at once in different places (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. ), then Windows 8 may be better. The main reason why Microsoft has made it so easy to switch between these two versions of Windows is because they both use the same core components – Windows, Internet Explorer, etc. So when you install an update from either version onto your computer, you’ll get updates automatically as well. This means that, even though there are some differences between them, it’s still possible to upgrade without having to reinstall. There are, however, other reasons why switching back and forth can make sense too. For example, if you’re using multiple computers with different software installed, such as Photoshop or Word documents, then Windows XP would probably work best for you, since it was designed specifically for those kinds of users.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is a touch-friendly OS, then Windows 7 will be better for you. However, if you want something that runs as fast and smoothly as possible, then Windows 8 may be just right for you.http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/opinion/sunday/the-great-american-health-care-scam.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss

 The Great American Health Care Scam 
 
 IN recent weeks, President Obama has been making his case against health care reform with an unusual mix of candor and evasion: He says he wants universal coverage, but won’t say how much he’ll spend in order to achieve it. And he’s not even promising to keep all existing programs intact. Instead, Mr. Obama’s plan would replace them one by one. But there’s another way to look at these claims.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If your primary goal in a new computer is for it to be fast, then yes, Windows 7 will do just fine. But if you’re more interested in having an easy-to-use interface and a powerful operating system, you’ll want something else. The best thing about Windows 8, however, is its simplicity. You can install any program from anywhere, including third-party programs like Adobe Photoshop CC, which has been updated with support for Windows 8. And there are no bloatware programs. This means less time spent cleaning up after yourself. For those who prefer simplicity over speed, Windows 8.1 may not be as appealing because of all the extra features Microsoft added — but it’s still better than anything else out there. Which version should I buy? There are two versions of Windows 8.1: one that’s optimized for tablets (the “Metro” version), and another that’s designed specifically for desktops (“the Classic”).","The answer to that question depends on your specific situation. The most common way of doing it, for example, would be by using a custom build system (such as the one I use). You can also run an installer from within Visual Studio and then install any other software you want into this environment if needed; however, there are some limitations with these builds because they require different tools than what's available in Microsoft Office 2010 R2. For more information about how we do our own installs see my article How To Install A Custom Build System In VS 2012, here goes…

 I've been working around issues like ""Windows XP SP1"" which means no installation at all! It may not seem obvious but when installing new versions without having installed them manually before running their latest version – especially after upgrading windows 10 - sometimes things just don't work out so well... So let me explain why….","I've been using the latest version of Microsoft's operating system for a while now, and I'm pretty sure that it has some advantages over its predecessor. It works well with my existing PC (which was running Linux), but there are still plenty more things to do in terms about your computer – like playing games on Xbox One, watching TV online from Netflix.","The first thing I would say to anyone who has been using the operating system for a while, and even if you haven't used it in years (or at least not as much), are your options. You can upgrade from an older version of OS X with no problems whatsoever; there's just one problem – Microsoft doesn't offer any support on Macs that run Linux anymore than they do Ubuntu/Debian distributions like Fedora / CentOS. And this isn 'just about all'. So what does ""better"" mean when compared against other versions available today? Well…well….you get my point! The best way out of these issues will be by upgrading back into newer software which runs more smoothly under certain conditions such things may become easier once again after some time off work-life balance changes have taken place over many months due towards retirement age etc..","The answer to this question depends on your specific situation. If you're using a Mac, it's probably best for the most part – but if you have an Android phone and want more control over what apps are shown in their settings menu (or even just how much they show up), then there may be some advantages that come with having OS X installed as well. However…if I'm going to use my iPhone 5s running iOS 9/10 instead of macOS 10.12 because Apple has made changes which will make things easier when upgrading from older versions …well maybe not all those improvements would work out so easily!","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. The most common way for a user to upgrade from the previous version of OS X and then get back into it, however, may be via an update that's not available in MacOSX 10.10 Yosemite (or later). This means you'll need some sort ""installer"" software like Adobe Acrobat Reader before upgrading—and if there are no updates installed at all by default when installing macOS Sierra 11 with SP1+, Apple has already removed them altogether as well."

Martin Odersky: Scala makes almost all aspects of programming easier than Java.Scala is much faster than Java because for-comprehensions and maps in languages like Scala are at least 30% faster than iterations with While loops in languages like Java .Actually in Scala Enumeration has a much simpler meaning than in Java.While this may not seem huge, Scala code is way more compact than Java. It is also important to notice that java has such benefits as I found that Java code easier than scala because may be I'm unaware of scala syntax.In Scala, functions can have varargs (variadic arguments), like the newer versions of Java.IDE support for Java is much better than Scala but like you say Scala (and tools) will improve.","After much thought, I realized that  scala is better, because: easier, faster, simpler. Yet, java should also be noticed for it is: code, syntax, newer.","I think that the best way to answer this question would be by asking a different question: what are you going to do with your life if Java doesn’t work for you? If you’re not using Scala, then you’ll probably end up writing some kind of web application in Java. But how will it work? How can you use it? And why should anyone care? The first thing we need to understand about Scala’s type system and its ecosystem is that, while it’s quite powerful, there isn’t really any reason to write code in it. It’s just another language feature. This means that most people who want to learn more about programming languages have no choice but to start learning Java, which has been around since 1995. As such, they don’t even know where to start. Even though there’s an entire community devoted to teaching programmers how to program in JavaScript, that’s still pretty much all they’re likely to learn.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from your programming language. If you’re looking for a language with lots of features and powerful libraries, then Java might be better than Scala, but if you’re more interested in writing code which can run quickly without having to worry about performance issues, then JavaScript may be better. In any case, there are many other languages out there, so it doesn’t really matter where you choose to spend your time. The point is, though, that choosing one particular language over another isn’t always as simple as picking between two different languages. There are plenty of reasons why someone would prefer one specific language, such as: 
 
 Performance – Many people find JavaScript’s speed appealing. It has been used by some very big companies like Google and Facebook (among others) and it’s easy enough to get started with. Ease of learning – Learning new technologies takes time and effort, especially when they involve unfamiliar concepts. For example, even though JavaScript was created back in 1995, its syntax hasn’t changed much since then.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is a language with an expressive type system and a high degree of expressiveness, then Java might be better than Scala, but if your aim is something more like functional programming, then Scala may be better. There seems to be some disagreement about this, so it would probably help to read up on both languages. The main reason why people say they prefer one over another is because there is no clear winner in terms of expressiveness. In my opinion, Scala has much higher levels of expressiveness than Java, which makes its syntax easier for beginners to learn. But even though Scala has many features that make it easy to learn, it's still not as good at expressing things concisely. For example, consider this: 
 
 This code looks pretty good, but how does it actually work? Well, we have two functions - f() and g(). Both take three arguments: f is the function name, g is the argument type, and r is the return value.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something that will help you get things done quickly, then Java might be better. But if you’re more interested in developing your own software and have some experience with other languages, then Scala may be better suited than Java. In fact, there are many people who prefer both languages because they can work together seamlessly. The main reason why we chose Scala over Java, however, was its type system. This means that all of our code has one single type, which makes it easy to write programs without worrying about how they’re going to behave. We also like the fact that it’s possible to define new types at compile time, so we’re not forced into writing boilerplate code. And finally, since we don’t need any libraries written by others, there’s no risk involved when using it. How do you use it? Our first project started as an experiment but quickly turned out to be quite successful.","I am not a big fan of Scala, but it has some nice features. For example, the type system makes code much easier to read and write. Also, there are many libraries that can be used for building web applications. However, Java is still very popular in enterprise environments. It seems like most people use it. If you want to build an application with Java, then you have two options: 
 
 Use JVM (it’s really easy to get started with). This means using the latest version of Java. You will need to install all necessary packages from Maven repository. Build your own application. The main advantage here is that you don’t need any other tools besides java. There are tons of free open source projects out there. But if you decide to go this route, make sure you know how to write code. Don’t just copy paste what someone else wrote. Make sure you understand why something works as well as it does. And above all, learn about programming concepts.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't just a simple programming language, then it's probably not worth the effort of learning something new and using some existing libraries that are already available in other languages (e., C++). However if you want more advanced features like object-oriented design with an emphasis towards performance optimization rather than scalability as well – I think there will be many people who would love to learn about these things but don' t have time for them yet! So let's take one example from my experience while working at Google where we were building our own web application called ""Google Glass"". We had built such applications before because they used OpenGL ES 3 which was supported by most Android phones when running inside Chrome OS.","The best way to learn about the language and its history, especially in a world where you can't read it on your phone. It's also great for learning how languages work together with other programming concepts like closures (which are often used as an example of what we call ""functional"" vs functional imperative).","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal isn't just a simple programming language, then it's probably not worth the effort of learning more than one thing at once!","I'm not sure what I'd call it. It's a very simple language that has many different features and uses the same syntax as Haskell, but with some of its more interesting quirks (like using an array instead of just one). The main difference between this approach and other languages like C++/Java are in their use cases; they're all pretty similar to each other so you can get away from them without having any problems at first! In fact, most people who have used these two approaches will probably agree on something if only because there isn't much else out here about how programming works outside your comfort zone :) So let me give my take-away for now... The best way to learn new things while learning ClojureScript would be by reading through those books before trying anything further - even though we've already covered both techniques quite extensively!","The first thing to note about this article, and the one that I've been following for a while now, are two things. First off, it's not really an exhaustive list of what you can do with your language in general (although there may be some good ones out here), but rather just how much work goes into making sure all those different parts fit together so well as seamlessly integrate them on top! Second though… if we're going from writing code like ""Hello World"" onto something more complex than simply using java, then why bother doing anything else when everything works perfectly fine without any effort at ALL?! And finally – let me tell ya right away :) It doesn't matter whether they use JVM/JavaScript."
3,Swift,Objective-C,"Swift may be easier to learn and work with, but it will still take developers time to switch from Objective-C, Hilwa speculated.
There is more Swift to learn but Cocoa was written in Objective C and it doesn't make use of these features, so they're not as essential for doing iOS development today.","Another advancement is the introduction of Swift, a much simpler, easier to use and faster programming language than Objective-C, which Apple had been relying on for years.
Swift is a new programming language that can create apps for both iOS and OS X, and that Apple says is easier to work with than the current Objective-C.",". According to Apple, Metal significantly decreases the overhead required for generating 3D graphics, while Swift offers a number of performance improvements for applications developed in it compared to the language currently used by iOS developers, Objective-C.
Swift is a new programming language that can create apps for both iOS and OS X, and that Apple says is easier to work with than the current Objective-C.","Looks like swift is better.

However, objective-c is not be ignored, because it is Dare I also say that learning Objective-C may be a tad easier than Swift, only because Objective-C does not contain some of the more advanced features as Swift such as functional patterns, generics, and advanced enumeration and collection features.Dare I also say that learning Objective-C may be a tad easier than Swift, only because Objective-C does not contain some of the more advanced features as Swift such as functional patterns, generics, and advanced enumeration and collection features.Dare I also say that learning Objective-C may be a tad easier than Swift, only because Objective-C does not contain some of the more advanced features as Swift such as functional patterns, generics, and advanced enumeration and collection features.","swift seems to prevail due to its pros: faster, simpler, easier to use. However, objective-c is not be ignored, because it is: features, patterns, generics.","I think that the best way to answer this question would be by comparing them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. In my opinion, there are two main reasons why they both have a place on our list. The first reason has to do with how much you can customize your code. If you’re writing an app for iOS devices, then it’s easy enough just to use one language over another. However, if you’re developing software for Android, it becomes more complicated. You need to take into account things like battery life, security, performance, etc. These differences make it hard to choose between them. For example, Android apps tend to run faster than iOS, but that’s not necessarily because they’re written using Swift. It’s probably due to some combination of factors such as memory usage, network latency, and other factors. On top of that, there’s also the fact that Android developers don’t always write code in Swift, so sometimes we end up having to deal with third-party libraries instead of native ones.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a simple app that does one thing, then Swift will be fine for you. However, if you want something more complex, like an iOS app, and have some experience with Swift, Objective-C might make sense. In fact, it makes sense even in cases where you don’t know much about Swift. For example, we recently wrote a small iPhone game called “Angry Birds” using both Swift and Objective-C. The main difference between them was how they handled memory management. We used Swift’s garbage collector, which uses a lot of memory, but also managed memory. This meant that when our application crashed, all data would stay around until we could get back into it. With Objective-C, however, everything stays around, including any objects created by other users. When things crash, there isn’t anything left behind except empty space — so no matter what, we’ll end up crashing again.","I think that the best way to answer this question would be by comparing them in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. In my opinion, they are both great languages, but there are some things about each one which make it better than the other. Let’s start with what makes Swift a good language for iOS development. 1. The syntax 
 
 One thing you will notice immediately when using any programming language, especially if you’re used to writing code in Java, C++ or Python, is how much easier it becomes after learning Swift. This isn’t just because it’s more readable, but also because there’s less repetition involved. For example, instead of having to write something like this: 
 
 var x = new String(); 
 console.log(x, y); // print “Hello world” 
 
 You can now simply write: 
 
 var y = new Double();Console.WriteLine(“Hello, World!”) 
 
 2. The type system 
 
 Another big advantage of Swift, as compared to other languages such as Java or C++, is its type system.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what kind of programmer you are. If you’re a beginner and want to learn how to program in Swift, then it’s definitely worth it. But if you’re more experienced with programming languages like Java and C++, it might not be as beneficial. For example, when learning Java, you’ll often find yourself writing code like: 
 
 var x = new String(); 
 
 This isn’t very efficient, but it does get the job done. In contrast, using an object literal for each variable can make your code much faster. However, there are some downsides to this. First, objects have no lifetimes, so they can’t outlive their own value. Second, because they’re immutable, there’s nothing stopping someone from changing them at any time. Third, even though these methods return objects, they don’t actually know anything about them. You could create a method called “get” which returns a string object, but you’d never really know whether that’s true until after you’ve run the code.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write code in a language with better support for concurrency, then it makes sense to use Swift. However, if you want to build an app using Objective-C, there are many other languages out there. For example, React Native uses JavaScript and TypeScript as its primary programming language. It has been designed from scratch specifically for building apps without having to deal with any of Apple’s frameworks such as iOS or OS X. The main advantage of ReactJS over native development tools like XCode is that it allows developers to focus more on writing code, rather than worrying about how their application will look when they deploy it. This means that the developer can concentrate on making sure everything works correctly before deploying it, instead of spending time fixing bugs after deployment. Another benefit of ReactJS compared to traditional web technologies is that it’s easier to get started with. You don’t have to learn all these new things at once.","I'm not sure. I've been using it for a while now and have no idea what to expect from the language, but there are some interesting things that can be done with this library in general (and maybe even more specific) than just writing code on top of an existing framework like C#. The main difference between these two languages isn't so much semantics as syntax; you don' t need any special constructs such ""if"" statements which will return true if something happens before returning false ; instead, they're used when creating new objects, where one object may contain multiple values at once rather then only each value being represented by its own type variable :

 If we want to write our program without having anything written about us yet again - let's say... We'll create three different types based off their properties! This means all 3 classes should correspond to exactly same attributes! In other words, every class has unique methods called'methods'.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. It's not that I'm against the language, it's just how we use them and what they do for us in our apps (and on iOS).","The first thing you should know about the difference between a programming language and an object oriented one. You can use any of these languages to create your own objects, but they are not necessarily equivalent in terms (or even close).","I'm not sure what to make of this. I think it's a good idea, but the fact that you can't use C++11 without using Objc and CocoaPods makes me wonder if there are any other languages out here with similar features as Java (or even Python).","The first question I asked myself was, ""How do you write a program that works with the language?"" The answer to this one would be simple. You can use any programming paradigm and it will work well for your application in many different ways including but not limited just using C++11 as an example (and yes there are some other languages out here). However if we look at what's possible on iOS 10 then our goal should be something like CocoaPods which has been around since before Apple released their OS X SDKs back when they were still called MacOSX. So let me give another quick overview of how these frameworks come together so far…

 I've written about all three above mentioned paradigms over time because those two have become very popular amongst developers who want more control from within code than ever prior to release date changes such things could happen!"

However, php is not be ignored, because it is: simpler, web, cheaper.","I am not sure which one to choose. There are many reasons why you should choose a programming language over another. The main reason that people prefer Java is the ease of learning and use. It has been around for quite some time now so there isn’t much need to learn new things in order to use it. Another big advantage of using Java is its support for multiple languages. This means that if your company needs more than just PHP, then it can easily switch between languages without any problems. You will also be able to work with different technologies such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc. In addition, since these platforms have become popular, they tend to attract developers who want to build their own applications instead of buying commercial software. If you do decide on choosing a particular language, make sure that you know what features you need. For example, when building an application that uses JSP, you may find yourself needing to access data from other services besides the web server. These services might include databases, file storage, etc.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a web application and get it up and running quickly, then Java might be better than PHP. However, if you want to build something more complex with some kind of backend (database, etc), then JavaScript may be better. In fact, in my opinion, both languages have their pros and cons. For example, when building an application, we should always try to avoid using any language which has not been designed for it. This means that whenever possible, use libraries from other languages, such as Ruby or Python. But sometimes it’s nice to create our own custom languages. We can do so by creating new frameworks like Backbone.js, React.js or AngularJS. These will allow us to develop applications without having to learn all those different technologies first. Which one would you rather use? The choice between these two programming languages comes down to personal preferences. Personally, I prefer JavaScript.","I have been using both for a long time and they are very similar in their features. However, there are some differences between the two that make them stand out from each other. For example, PHP has an object oriented programming model which makes it easier to write code with many classes instead of just one class per object. Java on the other hand uses functional programming. This means you can use functions as well as objects but not both. In this article we will see how these features differ. The Differences Between Both Languages 
 
 There are several reasons why people prefer either language over another. One reason being that JavaScript allows developers to create complex applications without having to worry about performance issues. Another reason is because both languages support multiple inheritance so you don’t need to duplicate code. Finally, both languages allow programmers to define custom types such as arrays and dictionaries making your application more flexible than if you were only writing functions. Why Choose JavaScript?","I am not a programmer and have no idea what the difference is. But if you are going to use PHP, then it should be because of its ease of use. If you want something more advanced, go for Java. It has been my experience that Java developers tend to get stuck in their own way when they try to learn new things. They don't like change. And most importantly, they don’t know how to make it. So, why would anyone choose PHP over Java? The answer lies with the fact that PHP does not force you into using an external library. You can write your code as much as you want, but only after you’ve written all the necessary code. This means that there will always be some parts which need to be done by hand. For example, writing database queries requires knowledge about MySQL.","I think that the main reason why people choose one over another is because of their own preferences. If you are a beginner and want to learn how to code, then JavaScript might be better for you. But if you already know some basic programming concepts, but still need more help with understanding what it means when something does not work, then Java may be better. You can also use both languages at different stages in your career. For example, if you have been working on web applications since before 2000, then maybe learning Ruby would be easier than JavaScript. However, if you just started out as an engineer 10 years ago, then perhaps using Python will give you enough confidence to start developing real applications. In any case, there really isn’t much difference between them. Both languages offer many features which make them very useful tools for programmers. Which language should someone learn? There are two major reasons why choosing one language over another depends on personal preference. The first is whether you plan to work full-time or part-time.","In the past, I've been a bit of an advocate for using JavaScript in my code. It's easy to get started with it and you can use any language that supports HTML5 (or even CSS3). But there are some things about Javascript which make this approach less appealing than other languages like C#/JavaScript. The main difference between these two approaches is how they're implemented on your system - if something works well enough then all else fails!",,,"It's not a question of whether you should use JavaScript, but rather how to write your own. It can be done in any language that supports it (e-mailing lists and JSON). You'll need an existing database with the correct schema for this project so we're going straight into SQL Server using MySQL instead. We've got some basic data types here as well which will help us get started quickly on our next step! The first thing I want from my new projects are simple tables; they have no dependencies at all - just add them yourself if needed by writing something like table_name('mytable'). This way whenever someone asks me what type of column names there are available then their query won't fail because everything works correctly when used together without having to worry about anything else whatsoever...","I'm not sure if I can say for certain that the two are related. The first thing to note here, and it's a good one at this point in time, was how much of an impact they had on my development workflow (and also what kind). It wasn't until after we started working together as part of our team last year when things got really interesting about each other – which led me into writing some code with them! We've been friends since high school so there were lots more opportunities than ever before… but now he has his own project where you have access all your data from any source imaginable without having to worry too many people around him who might be using something like MySQL/MariaDB etc.."

If you want a simple interface that does not require any additional software and can be used with your existing home theater system, then the best choice for you would probably be an iOS device. However, if you have more than one device in your home, such as multiple TVs, gaming consoles etc. then it might make sense to go for another platform. For example, if you already own a Roku device, but also use other streaming devices like Chromecast or Fire TV, then there may be some benefit of using those instead. On the other hand, if you only need a single set-top box which will work across all devices, then perhaps the best option would be Android. In fact, Android has become quite popular among users because of its ease of use, low price and wide range of applications. So, while we do recommend choosing between these two platforms depending on how many different devices you have, here are our top 5 picks from each platform: 
 
 5.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your TV. If you’re looking for a device that will play all of the latest movies and television shows, then Apple’s new set-top box might be just right for you. But if you’d rather have something more akin to an Android tablet, then you’ll likely prefer Google’s Nexus Player. Both devices are powered by Android, but they offer different features — one has access to Google Play services, while the other does not. And both can stream content from services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Instant Video, Vudu… 
 
 Which streaming media player do I want? There are many options when it comes to streaming media, so it’s important to choose which product fits best into your needs. Here are some tips we found helpful: 
 
 1. Choose a good deal. Streaming video subscriptions tend to cost less than cable subscriptions, especially in markets where there aren’t as many options.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your TV. If you’re a cord cutter, the choice between an iPad and an iPhone may be easy. But if you’re looking for something that can do more than just play games, watch movies and listen to music, then it’s clear which device will suit you. For those who don’t mind paying extra for features like 4K video playback, Apple’s new set-top box could make sense. It’s not as powerful as other streaming devices, but it does have some unique features. It also has better battery life than its competitors, so you’ll likely get through most of one movie before having to plug in again. And unlike Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast and others, the Apple TV doesn’t require any special hardware — all you need are HDMI cables and Wi-Fi connectivity. Image courtesy of Flickr, jpwnn. TL;DR Apple's latest gadget, the Apple TV, offers many of the same benefits as competing devices at lower prices. Here's how they stack up.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your TV. If you’re looking for a streaming-media player that can play all the latest video formats, then Apple’s new set-top box might be just right for you. But if you’re more interested in watching movies and television shows without having to switch between different apps, then you’ll probably prefer an Android device. And finally, if you’d rather watch videos with subtitles than dubbing, then there’s no doubt about it: iOS devices are far superior when it comes to playing back videos. What’s more, while both of these platforms have their own strengths — especially as they relate to content consumption — they’re not mutually exclusive. In fact, it’s possible to use one platform over another depending on how much time you’ve set aside each day for entertainment. For example, Netflix users who like to stream lots of TV episodes will find themselves using the iPad app even though they already have access to Netflix’s streaming service.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you’re a casual user, the iPad Air 2 will be fine. But if your main goal in buying an iOS device was for gaming, then you’ll want something with more horsepower. And that’s where the new iPhone 7 Plus comes in. It has all of the power and features you’d expect from Apple’s latest iPhone. It’s also much cheaper than its predecessor, which makes it even better value. Why buy it? For gamers, it’s hard not to. With games like Fortnite and Clash Royale, there isn’t anything else that can keep up with it. Plus, there’s no other smartphone out there as powerful as the iPhone 7. You won’t find another phone at this price point with such impressive specs. How long does battery life last? This one might surprise you. While most smartphones last around two hours when using them heavily, the iPhone 7’s battery lasts about four hours.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The iPhone 6 and the iPad Air are both great, but they're not as good. Both have their own strengths that make them stand out from other devices in terms of performance (and price). But there's no denying that each device offers its unique advantages over others — especially when it comes time for an upgrade plan with new features like Siri integration on all three models.","The answer to that question will be a resounding yes. The iPhone 5s and 6 Plus are both great, but the iPad Pro has been out for years now with no real competition from its predecessor (the iPod touch).","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. The iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2 are the most popular devices, but they have a few other features that make them more expensive than their competitors (like Siri).","The answer to that question depends on your specific needs. If you're looking for a new device, there are some options available in the App Store and Google Play stores such as Roku's Fire Stick (which has been around since 2007), Amazon Prime Video ($49) with its Alexa voice assistant; iMovie from Netflix/Amazon Instant Movies at $19 per month plus free trial of Hulu Plus service through iTunes Music Unlimited if purchased separately via an app store like YouTube).","The answer to this question depends on which version you're using. The iPhone 4S and the iPad Air 2 are both compatible with a variety of devices, including those that support third-party apps like iTunes Music (which supports all major music services), Google Play Movies & Sports from Amazon Video Services as well as other streaming media players such Asphalt 8 HD for Android phones; Windows Phone 7/8 has also been tested in some cases by Microsoft's own testing program called ""Microsoft Testing.""

However, ruby has pluses too. Ruby is actually even higher level than python.Ruby, which is much newer than Python has Ruby Gems !","It's a hard decision but I choose python. Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: greater, faster, bigger. It is also important to notice that ruby has such benefits as higher, newer.","I think Python has the edge in terms of ease of learning and maintainability, but it also seems to be a bit more difficult for some people to get their head around than Ruby. For example, if you are used to writing code that works with multiple threads, then this may not seem like such an issue. However, if you’re using threads on your web application, you’ll need to learn how to use locks and synchronisation primitives properly. This can take time – especially when dealing with concurrent code. If you want to start working on this, I’d suggest starting from scratch rather than trying to pick up something that’s already been established. As far as performance goes, both languages have very similar performance. The main difference between them is memory usage. In Ruby, there will usually be many small objects which must all be allocated at once, whereas in Python, each object only needs one object. So while Ruby’s memory usage might look low, it’s actually quite low. On average, most applications should run fine without any significant slowdown. Which language do you use?","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to write a simple web application that displays some text and then sends it over HTTP, Python will probably be fine. But if you’re writing an app for something like Google Docs, where people need to interact with it, you’ll want Ruby. And even then, it’s not clear which language would be better. The two most popular choices in terms of popularity seem to be: 
 
 1. Go back to the drawing board and rewrite everything from scratch. This seems unlikely because there aren’t any good alternatives out there. 2. Use one of these three: Ruby, Python, Go. These three languages have been around longer than Go, so they should already know how to do it. However, since Go has had its fair share of issues recently, I’m going to stick with Ruby.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/02/14/bc-bc-marijuana-legalization-campaign.html

 B.C.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from your programming language. If you’re looking for a language that will make it easy to write code quickly, then Python might be better than Ruby. But if you’re more interested in writing high quality code, and are willing to spend some time learning Python, then Ruby may be better. In fact, there really isn’t much of an argument between these two languages. They both have their strengths and weaknesses, but they work well together. The other thing about languages like Ruby, Python, and JavaScript is that, while they’re all great languages, none of them has been around as long as Java has. This means that there’s not nearly enough history behind them. It’s also why it’s so hard to compare one against another. For example, when comparing Ruby with Java, we can see how different things were back then. When comparing Python with JavaScript, we can’t tell which features made each language better, because those differences aren’t apparent until later. And even though Java’s syntax was very similar to Ruby’s, its implementation wasn’t quite as good.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is to build a web application with Rails and Python, then Python will be better for you. But if you want to develop an app in Ruby, it may not be. The reason being that, as we have seen before, there are many things which can go wrong when developing apps using Ruby. For example, one of the most common problems encountered by developers working with Ruby is that they don’t know how to use the built-in database features such as ActiveRecord, Hibernate etc. This means that their code might get into trouble because they didn’t take care about these features. Another problem is that some libraries like Spring don't work well with Ruby. In addition, there are other issues related to performance (memory usage, etc). So while Ruby seems to offer more features, it’s still far from perfect. So, should you choose Ruby? Well, let’s start off with its strengths first. It has been around since 1998 so it was already quite old.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to write a small application and have it run in one of two environments, then Python will be fine. But if you want something more complex, like an app with many users interacting over time, then Ruby may be better. In fact, there are some great books out there about how to use both languages for web development. The best book I’ve found so far is “Web Development With Rails”. It covers all aspects of Ruby, including its syntax, which can make things easier when writing Ruby. It’s also very well written, but it’s not as good at explaining why certain features work better than others. For example, they don’t explain much about how ActiveRecord works (I’m assuming that’s because they’re using it), although they do cover other features. They also spend quite a bit of time talking about Django (which isn’t really relevant to Ruby), though they mention it briefly in passing during their discussion of Django’s architecture.","I've been using the language for a while now, and I'm not sure what it's like to be able do anything with that.","The answer to this question depends on which language you're using. For example, if your codebase uses C++ and Java (or any other programming languages), then the best way for a beginner would be to use either of those two libraries as their primary source files in order to get started with writing simple programs that are easy enough to understand without having to learn anything else about them! If there's one thing I've learned from my experience working at Microsoft over the years – it can help me write more complex software than just ""Ruby"" because they have so many different ways to do things like creating new objects; building out systems such AsyncTask, etc. ; but also doing some basic stuff while running tests/tests against existing data structures… So what does all these tools mean when compared by how much time we spend coding each tooling up our own projects versus learning something completely unrelated?!","I've been using the R package for a while now and I'm not sure how many people have used it. It's pretty easy to get started with, but if you're new here then this tutorial might be worth your time (and money) just because of its simplicity!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't just making a simple web application, but also building something that's easy for anyone who wants to learn it and has the time (or money) required to do so, then I'd say there are some things which can be done in both languages without having any coding experience at all! But if they aren't enough of an investment into learning how to code with one language over another, why not try out other programming paradigms like C#/JavaScript instead?","I've been using the language for a while now, and I'm not sure if it's worth trying out. It seems to be very popular in my area of expertise (Python), but there are some things that make this more difficult than others - like having too many variables at once when you're writing code! So here's what we do know about ruby-ruby."

But it will be useful for you to know that java is: easier to understand, programmer, programmers.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something that will make your life easier, then Perl and Python are probably better choices. But if you’re more interested in making things easier than that, then Ruby might be better. In fact, there isn’t really any language out there that’s perfect at all of these things. There are some languages which excel at one thing but not another. For example, JavaScript excels at creating web pages quickly with little effort. However, it doesn’t do much else. It’s great when writing simple scripts like an email client. It can also help create complex applications using JavaScript. But, it’s terrible when it comes to building large applications. The same goes for Ruby. You can’t write a whole application without having to use ActiveRecord, JSON, etc. Ruby’s strengths lie in its ability to build small applications, so you’ll find yourself spending most of your time working around those weaknesses. On the other hand, Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP have strong points as well.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a web application and not worry about performance, then Perl might be better than Java. But if you want to build an enterprise application, with all of its dependencies, then it may make sense for you to use Perl. In fact, there have been many times when I’ve used both languages at once, but only one was faster in my tests. The reason why I say “maybe” is because I’m still working out how much performance difference each language really provides. For example, let’s assume we need to do some database queries. Let’s also assume that our code will run on multiple platforms. We can choose between two different databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL). One advantage of using MySQL over Postgres is that it’s easier to scale up from 1 server to 100 servers. Another advantage is that it has more features.","I think Perl and Java are both great languages. But the main reason why they are so popular is that there is a lot of money in them. The average salary for an engineer working on one of these languages is around $80,000. That means you can make more than twice as much with Perl. And if you’re not making enough money, then maybe it’s time to look at other options. If your company has been paying salaries below $50,000, it might be worth looking into alternatives like Ruby on Rails or Python. These two technologies have become very popular. They also offer better benefits packages compared to Java. In fact, Python was recently voted by Forbes magazine as the most powerful programming language out there. So what do we need to know about how to choose between them? Here are some things to keep in mind: 
 
 1. Are You Making Enough Money?A good way to determine whether you will earn enough income from your job depends on several factors. For example, does your employer pay taxes?","The answer to this question depends on the kind of language you are writing in. If your goal is to write a program that can be run by any computer with an Internet connection, then Perl and Java will do just fine. But if your aim is to build something more complex, such as a web server, database server or messaging system, then Ruby may not cut it. In fact, it might even make things worse. This article assumes no prior knowledge about programming in either language. It also ignores some important considerations when choosing between them. For example, I would recommend using Ruby for projects where performance matters because it's faster than Perl. However, there are many other reasons why one should use Ruby, including its ease of use, flexibility, readability, type safety, security, etc. Why Use Ruby? There are several good arguments against Ruby. First, most people who have tried it find it difficult to use. Second, while it has been around since 1991, it hasn't really caught on. Third, although it does offer great features like threads, it doesn't provide much support for concurrency.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something that will help you solve real-world problems, then Perl and Python are probably better choices. But if you’re more interested in learning how to program computers than solving real-life problems with your computer, then Ruby might be just right for you. In fact, it’s so popular because it has been designed as an easy-to-use language that’s easy to learn but still powerful enough to do real work. The other big advantage of using Ruby over another scripting language, like Python, is its ability to run multiple processes at once. This means that, unlike Java, which only supports one process per thread, Ruby’s multiprocessing capabilities let you have several threads running simultaneously, each doing different things. You can even split up tasks into separate threads, such as writing code while someone else does some work (say, updating their profile). Another important feature of Ruby, called “events,” lets you write asynchronous code, where events happen every time certain conditions occur.","There are a few things that you can do with the language. You could write your own code, but it would be much more difficult to understand what's going on in this world than writing an application for Python and Ruby (or any other programming languages). The best way to learn about these concepts was by reading books like ""The Language of Programming"" from George R.R Martin himself! If I had written my first book as well then probably not so many people wouldn't have read those two articles because they're just too boring at times; however there were some great resources out online which helped me get started quickly enough without having to spend hours researching each topic myself… So here we go again – how does one use JVM? Let's start off our journey into using Scala.",I think that the best way to learn about programming languages and their use cases would be through a course on how they work.,"The answer to this question depends on your perspective. You may be familiar with the term ""JavaScript"" and you might not know that it's a programming language, but there are many different languages available for scripting in various ways (including JavaScript). The most common way of doing things like writing code using Javascript comes from Ruby/Javascript; however, if one wants more control over how they write their programs then I recommend looking into Python as well because its very similar syntax compared both platforms! If we look at our current state here, let us say PHP has been around since 2004 so far. It was originally written by John Houghton who wrote his first book called Programming Languages which he later ported back onto Linux where nowadays all modern web browsers support JVM based systems such AsyncIO-based applications etc. This means no need any further explanation about what makes an application work properly when running scripts within them!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying it at. In general, I'd say that the best way to get started with a language like C++ and/or Python would be by using an IDE (which can help in some cases).","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't just the development of a language, then there are many other languages that can be used in production and others which don' need it as much (e-commerce)."

Python syntax is much easier to read than Java.The simpler syntax of Python makes those apps faster to code than with Java.In practice I find that my Python programs perform somewhat better than Java, probably because Python has many libraries implemented in C, whereas Java has many pure Java libraries. But you should also take into account the advantages of java. Java and C are much faster than dynamic Python.Java programs are longer than their equivalent python programs.This will be higher for Java than for Python.","I advise choosing python, for it is superior in the following aspects: easier, easier to read, simpler, but you should also take into account the advantages of java: faster, longer, higher.","I think it depends on the project. If you are working with a large number of people and need to be able to handle multiple languages, then Java will probably work better for you. But if your project only has one person who needs to use Python, then Ruby may be better. It also depends on what kind of language you want to use. For example, in my case, I wanted to write an app that would let me send emails from my phone using Python. However, this was not possible because I needed to have access to all the data stored in MySQL. So I decided to go back to Ruby. The main reason why I chose Ruby over Python was its support for JSON. This means that when someone requests something like “email me”, they can get everything about their message including the subject line as well as any headers used by the sender. In addition, there is no limit to how many messages you can send. You could even make more than one.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something more than just an implementation of some mathematical function, then Java might be better suited. But if your goal is to write code in any language and have it run anywhere, Python will do fine. In fact, it’s probably easier to learn Python. The reason being that, unlike Java, there are no special syntax rules which make writing programs difficult. You can use regular expressions without worrying about whether they work correctly. And as far as I’m concerned, that’s all you need to know. So how does Python compare with other languages? Well, let’s look at two different examples: Ruby and Java. Both languages were developed by people who had experience using them. They both take advantage of existing libraries like Django, Spring, etc. To me, these examples show why Python has become so popular. However, neither example shows anything new compared to Ruby. For example, Django uses ActiveRecord, while Spring doesn’t even support it. This means that developers don’t really know much about databases.","I have been using Java for a long time and it has always seemed to me that the language was not as good at expressing itself in terms of its syntax. It seems like there are many more ways to express things than just one way of doing things. This makes it hard to write code which does what you want when you want. In contrast, Python can do almost anything with very few lines of code. The syntax is simple enough so that even beginners can learn it. If you really need something done quickly, then use Java. But if your goal is to get some work done, then go ahead and use Python. You will be glad you did. About Me 
 
 I'm an engineer by profession but I've dabbled in programming since my early teens. My first computer was a Commodore 64 and I started writing programs on it from about age 12. Since then, I've worked professionally in several areas including web development, database administration, and software development. Most recently I've focused on teaching others how to develop websites and online applications.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is to write a web application and have it run in production then Java will be better than Python. But if you want to build an app for mobile devices where performance matters more than anything else (like a game console) then python might be better. For me personally, I would rather use Ruby because of its speed but also because it's easier to get started with it. However, there are people who prefer Python, so they can choose which one suits them best. Which language should I learn? There are many different choices out there. In my opinion, learning any new programming language is always worth doing. Learning languages like Ruby, Java, Scala etc. has helped me tremendously when building websites and apps. It gives me confidence about how things work inside our applications. It's not just about knowing some basic syntax - it's all about understanding why certain code works as well as it does.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. For me, Java has been my favorite language for many years. It was easy and fun to learn and it had great libraries available. In fact, there are so many good open source projects out there, it's hard to pick just one. But if you're looking at Python, then I'd say go with Python. It's easier than Java, but not as much fun. If you're interested in learning more about how these languages work, check out some of their tutorials. The best way to get started would be to start by reading through one of those tutorial posts. You can also read up on them here. Which Programming Language Is Right For You? There are two main reasons why people choose different languages. One reason is because they have specific skills required for certain jobs. Another reason is because they're used more. This article will help you figure which programming language fits your needs best. Let's take a look at each of them. 1.","I think it's a good question. I'm not sure what the best way to do this would be, but there are some great libraries out on GitHub that can help you with your project and make things easier for others (like Django).","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. It's not as simple, but it can be a good idea if your goal isn't just getting the most out of an app and making sure that everything works well with all platforms (e-commerce for example).","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal was a simple web application, then it's probably best for the first few steps of development and if that doesn't work out as well as some other things (like debugging), try using an IDE instead!","A lot of people have asked me about this question. I'm not sure what it means, but there are a few things that can help you out in the long run (and they're all pretty cool). The first thing to remember when choosing between python and Java for your project would be how much work goes into each language/framework compared with other languages on their own platform; if one has more than two different frameworks available then both will need some extra effort from developers who want to write code faster while maintaining compatibility across platforms as well! For example, many web applications use JavaScript instead because its easier & less expensive per line - which makes writing tests easy :) If we look at our current development environment vs previous versions where most projects were written using PHP's built-in test framework like Laravel 2, here comes an interesting difference...","The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you're a beginner, then it's probably best for beginners and if you want more advanced users (like me), the easiest way to get started with python-python will be through an introductory tutorial that covers all of those topics in detail!"

But you should also take into account the advantages of windows 98. IMO, Windows 98 is far superior to play older games on than Windows XP.","I am prone to choose windows xp, because: higher, stabler, younger. It is also important to notice that windows 98 has such benefits as older.","I have been using Linux since the early days of its release in 1993. At that time, it was a new operating system and there were very few people who had heard about it. It took me many years to get comfortable with it, but now I am quite familiar with most aspects of Linux. In fact, I can even use my laptop as an HTPC if I want to. But what really makes this OS so special for me are the two key features which make it different from other OSes: 1) The ability to run multiple applications at once on one computer 2) The ability to install programs without having to worry about compatibility issues between versions. This means you don’t need to upgrade your software every time something changes. You just click “Install” when you wish to update something. And that’s exactly how I like it! 1. Running Multiple Applications Simultaneously On One Computer 
 
 Most users will be surprised by this. They may think they would never do this, because it’s not possible to run more than one application simultaneously on any given computer.","The answer to this question depends on your personal preferences. For me, the choice was clear. I wanted a computer that would be able to run all of my software and games without any problems. In addition, it had to have enough power for everyday tasks like word processing, spreadsheets, web browsing, etc. And finally, it needed to be fast enough so that I could play most modern games. This meant having at least 2 GB RAM with an ATI Radeon X800 Pro video card capable of running up to 2GB/sec in game graphics. It also required being able to use two monitors simultaneously. Finally, it should not cost more than $2000. My first step towards building such a machine was to look into what kind of hardware was available. After some research, I found out about AMD's new Athlon 64 X2 processor line. At first, I thought they were too expensive but after reading many reviews from various websites, including Tom's Hardware magazine, I decided to go ahead and buy one. When I received it, I immediately installed it.","I have used both and they are very similar. The only difference between the two versions of windows 98 is that it comes with a lot more features than XP. For example, you can use your mouse to move around in windows, which was not possible on XP, but now is. You also get better support for multimedia applications, like video playback, audio playback etc. There are many other things about this version that makes it better. However, there were some problems when using it. One problem was that if you had multiple programs open at once, then one program would be left running while another application started up. This caused problems. Another thing that bothered me was that, even though my computer specs said that it could handle it, sometimes it wouldn't work properly. It took quite a bit of time before I figured out what was going on. Also, because of these problems, I decided to switch back to Windows. Which operating system do you think will win out? In general, people tend to vote based on their personal preferences.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your computer. If you’re looking for a computer that will run all the latest software and games, then you’ll probably be better off with an older version of Windows. However, if you’re more interested in using it as a personal computer, then it’s definitely worth considering upgrading to something newer than XP. In fact, some people even prefer running their computers at least two years old so they can get the most out of them. This means that they’re not going to have any problems running programs like Photoshop, which are still supported by Microsoft today. How long should I keep my computers? When buying new computers, make sure you buy one that’s compatible with your operating system. For example, if you plan to use Windows Vista, don’t go ahead and upgrade right away. Instead, wait until Vista comes out, because it’ll likely work just fine without it. Another thing to consider when purchasing a PC is whether you need a lot of memory.","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you are a casual user, then the choice between Vista and 7 will be very easy. However, if you need more than just basic functionality, such as word processing, spreadsheets, multimedia applications, etc., then it may make sense to go with XP. In fact, I would recommend that most people stick with XP until they have had enough time with both versions of Windows. This way, when Microsoft releases new versions, there will always be an upgrade path available. For those who want to take their computing experience into the 21st century, however, one thing should not be overlooked: Microsoft's operating system has been around for quite some time. It was first released in 1993, but its popularity only really took off after 2000. Today, it's still used by millions of people, including many business users. It's also available through several different editions, each offering something different. So even though there's no guarantee you'll get all the latest features, at least you're getting what works best for you.","The answer to this question depends on your operating system. If you are running a 64-bit version of Linux, then the best option for most people would be WinXP/98 (or any other OS with an older kernel). However if you're using 32 bit versions like Ubuntu and Debian it's possible that there may not have been enough time in which they were able run properly before their performance was affected by some bugs introduced during development at Microsoft Research Labs. The problem here isn't just about how many cores per CPU but also whether these CPUs can handle all those extra threads required when working together as one machine - especially since we've seen so much work done over years already!","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. If you're looking for a new operating system, the best bet would be either an older version of OS X (Windows 8) that's been updated since its release in 2010 and has some features like support for 64-bit systems such as OpenCL 2.0; 32 bit platforms are also possible but not recommended because they can cause problems with memory usage if used at all while running applications which may lead to crashes due simply to incorrect use of RAM resources when using these devices during booting from them. [1] The most common way I see it being done by default though seems more likely than others based upon my experience so far:[2][3]. In fact there have even gone into detail about how many times people get stuck trying different versions without any luck whatsoever after installing one despite having installed both before each other!","The answer to that question depends on your computer's operating system. If you're running a 64-bit version of Microsoft Office, for example (which has been updated since the release in March 2012), then it may be possible and likely worthwhile to upgrade from an older OS such as Vista/7 SP1 if there are any issues with its performance during installation; however, this will require some workarounds before upgrading further into newer versions of software like Visual Studio 2013. The best way to do so would be by using one of these free tools called ""Windows Update"", which allows users to download updates directly onto their computers without having to install them manually first – but not necessarily via third party programs either!","The answer to this question depends on your operating system. If you're using a 64-bit version of Linux, then the best option for most users would be an x86/64 based OS like Ubuntu (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS). However if you are running 32 bit versions of Microsoft's Office suite and want to run it in fullscreen mode with all its features installed without any extra effort from Adobe Photoshop CS6+, there may not seem much difference between these two platforms at first glance. The only thing that seems different about both systems though is their compatibility level – which means they will work together seamlessly across computers as well as tablets!","The answer to this question depends on your operating system. If you are running a 64-bit version of Microsoft's latest software, then the best option for most people would be either an older OS (like Linux) that has been updated with newer features and fixes over time; if not, it could still work fine as long ago as 2010 but will likely require some maintenance before being able run again in future versions."

This was especially true in the early days when it was still possible for developers to write code without having to worry about whether their application would run on an old version of Windows or not. But as more and more people started writing applications with web browsers other than Internet Explorer, this became less true. And now we have even fewer options available if you want to use a different language. In fact, one reason why many programmers choose Python over Ruby or Java is because they can easily switch between them. If you’re working on something where performance matters, then it’s worth considering switching from C++ to Python. However, there are some disadvantages too. For example, while both languages offer great support for concurrency, they’re not particularly good at handling concurrent I/O (read more here). Also, although both languages provide excellent error handling, there’s no built-in way to handle errors gracefully like you’d find in Java.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to write a web application that can be used by millions of people, then PHP will probably do just fine. However, if you want something more powerful, and have some experience with JavaScript, then PHP may give you an edge. This article explains why PHP has become so popular in recent years. The first thing we need to understand about PHP is its popularity. It was created as a scripting language for Web development back in 1995. Since then, it has been adopted by many different programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Perl, Java, C#, C++, Objective C, etc. Today, there are over 100 million active users worldwide who use it. In fact, it’s one of the most widely known languages out there. It’s also very easy to learn. You don’t even need any prior knowledge of programming. Just read through these articles from my personal blog which explain how to learn PHP quickly. Why Is PHP Popular? There are several reasons behind this.","I have to say that PHP has been the most popular choice for me since it was first released. It has a very nice syntax and can be used in many different ways. However, there are some downsides which make this language less suitable as an alternative to JavaScript. Here they are: 
 
 The lack of support for modules 
 
 There isn’t any module system at all (yet) 
 
 No type safety 
 
 Lack of documentation on how to use certain features 
 
 As far as I’m aware, no one else offers these advantages either. This means you will need to learn more about them before using them. For example, if you’re working with JSON files, you’ll probably want to know what happens when your server sends data back from another server. You won’t find out by reading documentation, because it’s not there. If you don’t understand why something works, then there’s nothing much you can do about it. Also, sometimes things aren’t explained well enough so that someone who doesn’t already know JS might get stuck.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your web application. If you’re looking for a fast, lightweight and performant PHP application, then the choice between these two languages will be obvious. However, if you’re more interested in building an application that can scale up and down with high performance requirements, then you’ll need to choose one of them. In fact, it’s not even clear which language would best suit our requirements. To help us make this decision, we have created a list of some common questions developers ask when they are deciding whether to use either language. We hope it helps you understand why choosing one over another might seem like a no-brainer. 1. Is there any way I could get my code into WordPress? This may sound obvious, but many people find themselves asking this question. While most modern CMS systems provide their own version of JavaScript, there’s no easy way around it. You can’t just import scripts directly without having them compiled first.","I have been using PHP for a while now and it has become my preferred language to write web applications. It is very easy to learn with the help of this book. You will get an overview on how to build your first website in PHP and then you can go deeper into each topic by reading more detailed tutorials. The book also includes many examples that are useful when building complex websites. This makes learning easier as well. How does it differ from other programming languages? There are several differences between PHP and other languages. For example, there are no comments in PHP code. In addition, PHP doesn't support any kind of syntax highlighting. However, these features make writing code much easier. Also, PHP supports multiple inheritance which means that if one class inherits something else, all classes inherit it. Finally, PHP allows anonymous functions so that variables cannot be accessed without being explicitly declared inside functions. These are some of the most important differences. Is it worth it?","I'm not sure what the best choice for a web application. I think it's probably Java, but that doesn't mean you should use any of them (unless they're really good).","I'm not sure if I can say this, but it's a good question. The answer to that depends on what you're trying and how much time your browser has available for the task at hand (or whether there are any other options). If we assume all browsers have some sort of ""pre-processed"" process called preprocessing which takes care in order where code gets executed before execution begins then our solution would look like so: We'll use jQuery as an example here because when using Javascript with ReactJS, everything looks pretty similar except JSX will be used instead of DOMS. This means no need either!","The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you're looking for a more advanced approach, try using the following code snippet from my blog post ""How To Use jQuery in Your Web Development"" (http://blog-of_theweek). It's pretty simple and it works great! I've also included some sample scripts that will help with any of these questions as well.","The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you're using a web application, it's best if the code that runs in front of an HTML5 browser will be written by hand and not compiled into something much more complex than just one line per page (e-mail). But for those who are writing websites with CSS3 markup languages like ReactJS/CSS2, there may be some advantages over having static files as opposed from dynamic ones such AsyncJs. In fact, I've seen people write scripts which run within their own pages without any need whatsoever to recompile them manually because they don't want to have anything else running at all!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't just getting a good performance, but also making it easy to write code that works well in the browser and makes sense for people who don`t have any experience with web development (or at least not yet), then I would say there are two options here...

 - You can use an IDE like Eclipse which has all of these features as part-time jobs so they won�ll be able do more than one job per day! This will make them easier if their work needs some extra time because most projects require lots/more tasks when working from home :) The other option seems much less likely since many developers want something similar without having had too long coding sessions before starting out using Java EE."

If your application needs a high level view of what is going on, then it makes sense to use Ethernet. However, if your applications need more fine-grained control over how packets get sent and received, then USB may be better. In either case, however, there will always be tradeoffs. For example, in order for an app like Facebook Messenger to work properly, it must have fast network connectivity. This means that any kind of latency can make Facebook’s service unusable. On top of that, many apps also require some sort of encryption when sending data. With no way to encrypt packets, these services could easily become unusable as well. There are, however, ways around all this. One example is using HTTPS. While HTTP does not guarantee privacy by default, HTTPS does. It uses SSL certificates instead of plain text https certificates. These allow users to browse websites without being tracked. Another option is using TLS with SSL.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is to connect a PC with an ethernet cable directly into the Internet, then it makes sense to use Ethernet. However, if you want to connect two computers using USB and have them share files between them, then there is no reason not to go for USB. You can get away without any additional hardware by just plugging in one of the devices that needs it. This way, both PCs will be able to access all their files, even when they are far apart. It also means that each computer has its own IP address so that other users cannot see anything from them. In addition, since only one device at a time need to talk over the network, there should be less chance of data loss. How do I know which type of network card works best with my PCs? There are several types of cards available today but most people prefer some kind of wireless card. Most laptops come equipped with built-in wireless, while desktop machines usually require external cards.","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you are looking for a USB 3.0 hub, then the choice between the two will be clear. However, if you want an ethernet hub with more ports, there may not be much difference in terms of performance. For example, some users have reported that their devices don't work well when connected directly through Ethernet. This can happen because they use a different type of cable than what comes standard with most devices. You should check whether it works before buying it. How fast does it work? It takes about 10 seconds from turning on the power button until all four ports light up. That means that each port has its own connection and therefore transfers data at up to 100MB/s. In other words, one gigabit per second transfer rate is possible using these ports. Is it compatible with my devices?

They also offer speeds ranging from 100 Mbps down to 1 Gbps.","The answer to this question depends on the type of data you are trying to send and receive. If your goal is sending a video file from one computer to another, then USB 2.0 will be fine. However, if you want to transfer large files between computers that have different operating systems, such as Windows XP and Mac OS X, then you’ll need an ethernet connection. This means that for most people, it would make more sense to go with Ethernet. In order to get started, I recommend downloading the free software called Wireshark (download here) which allows you to monitor all kinds of network traffic. It also lets you see what kind of traffic each device in your home has been getting. You can use Wireshark’s command line interface (CLI) to connect to any device, including computers, routers, switches, printers, scanners, etc.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is simply to connect a computer with an ethernet cable directly into the internet, then it makes sense to use Ethernet. However, if you want to do more than that, such as stream video from one PC to another, and also have multiple computers connected at once, then USB may be better. This will allow for faster data transfer speeds when using large files like HD video. You can read about how to choose which type of connection works best here. Which network adapter should I buy? There are many different types of adapters available that work well in various situations. Some people prefer to go with something simple because they don’t need anything too complicated. Others might find themselves needing to upgrade their equipment every few years so having some extra money isn’t always necessary.

 3 thoughts on “Choosing an ORM Database” 
 
 Thanks for this post. I’ve been trying to decide between PostGIS and Oracle, which seems more suitable for my needs. I’m currently working with PostGIS, though it’s still early days. My question is, how would you recommend choosing one? Is there anything that makes them better than each other?","I have been using Oracle for a long time and it has always seemed to me that the database was not very well designed in terms of its design. The way you can do things with databases are by adding more features. This means that there will be some kind of “middleware” which allows you to add new features without having to rewrite your whole database. In my opinion, this approach makes sense because most people don’t want to write their own custom code but rather use an existing one. So if we were going to build something new, we’d need to create our own. But what about those who prefer to keep everything as is? Well, that’s where MySQL’s advantage comes in. It provides us with all kinds of built-in tools like indexes, triggers, etc. so it’s easy to get started right away. And since we’re already familiar with MySQL, there’s no reason why we can’t just start writing applications on top of it. How does MySQL compare to other databases?","I have been using Oracle for a long time and it has always worked fine with my needs. But when you are working on big data sets that need to be replicated across multiple servers then the choice of database becomes very important. The main reason why I chose Postgres was because I wanted something which could handle large amounts of data. It also had an excellent performance compared to MySQL. In fact, this post will show how much faster Postgresql can perform than MySQL, even though they both use the same underlying technology. How does Postgresql’s performance compare to MySQL? Let’s start by looking at the performance of each database. Both databases offer great speed but there are some differences in performance. For example, Postgresql offers better throughput as well as lower latency. However, if we look at the latency side of things, MySQL wins out here.","I think that the choice depends on your use case. If you are using a database to store data in an online environment, then Oracle will be better for you. However, if you want to run multiple databases and have them all work together with no problems at all, then Postgres may be better. It has been my experience that most of the time when people say they prefer one over another, it really comes down to personal preference rather than any particular feature. For example, many people like MySQL, but some people hate it. In general, though, there isn’t much difference between them. Which Database Should You Use? There are two main types of databases: relational (column) and non-relational (non-row). The first type is used by almost every application out there. They both support basic operations such as SELECT * FROM tbl, UPDATE tbl, DELETE tbl, etc. These operations can also perform joins which allow you to combine different tables into one.","I have been using Oracle for a long time and it has always worked well with my needs. However, when you are working on large databases like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft Azure etc. then the choice of database becomes very important.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying and how much time your database has. If it's a relational DB, then that means the data structure of an application will be different from those in SQL Server (or any other version of MySQL). In fact if one uses both databases for their business logic they'll probably have similar results when using them together as well. However there may also exist some differences between these two systems which can make writing code more difficult than with either system at hand! So let's look into why we need postgresql vs mysql-post.","The answer to this question comes down to the fact that there are many different ways of doing things. The best way for a database system, as well in general, would be one where you have an SQL Server running on your machine and it's all about data access (and not just writing queries). This means having multiple databases with similar operations; each has its own set up which can take advantage of some common features such like caching etc., but also being able use other tools if needed so they're easy enough to implement without needing any additional knowledge from others who may already know what their needs really were before using them!","The answer to this question depends on your use case. For example, if you're using a database that supports SQLite and MySQL (or any other relational databases), then it's best not to write the entire application in one place for each of those applications; instead create separate tables with different namespaces so they can be used together without having to worry about creating multiple instances at once! If there are no more than two rows per column within an array-like structure such as table, but only three columns inside all four elements - which would make writing them very difficult -- consider adding additional indexes into these structures by specifying their values separately from what should appear elsewhere when doing anything else like querying data over HTTP/2.","The answer to this question depends on what you're doing. The best way to do it, as I've mentioned before (and many others), would be to use a database that's not in the wild and has no known problems with MySQL; if there are any issues then we can fix them using an alternative approach called ""postgresql"". This method will allow us more flexibility when dealing directly from your application code than writing SQL queries for other databases such AsyncDBs like MongoDb. If all of these approaches work well enough they should also make sense at some point during development time - but even so most people won't want their applications running without postgSQL support because those systems don' t have much experience working within production environments where data storage isn 'trouble free'. In fact one might argue simply by looking around how things currently look rather hard-coded into our software which makes debugging difficult!","The best way to find out about the differences between these two databases, and how they compare in terms of performance."
13,MySQL,SQLite,"also changed to use the Sqlite 3 database rather than MySQL , again , to make the .
If you for some reason decide to se a database (don't), you should consider SQLite instead of MySQL.
Well, I have to say that I'm more used to Oracle, postgresql, sqlite and ms sql server than mysql.","This package provides a module allowing you to use the SQLite self-contained database engine from within your PHP scripts, eliminating the need for a full SQL server installation like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
It uses an SQLite database by default but can be configured for use with MySQL or PostgreSQL.
By default Rails will use the sqlite database driver, but you may want to develop using MySQL.","LMS no longer uses MySQL for its database since version 7.6, when they started using SQLite files instead.
MySQL instead of sqlite.

So, here is how you use MySQL in Amarok instead of the default SQLite.
It uses an SQLite database by default but can be configured for use with MySQL or PostgreSQL.","I advise choosing mysql. For the database, I use SQLite as long as I can, migrating to MySQL if necessary to scale.We use the new OpenNebula MySQL backend which is faster than SQLite when dealing with thousands of VMs.Personally, I'd run rails with MySQL rather than SQLite, mainly because the MySQL management tools are so good.Its generally recommended that you use the same DB driver for your unit testing as you do for your application, so if you use SQLite for testing but MySQL for the actual application it could be worthwhile to run a few tests using MySQL instead. But i should tell you that sqlite is SQLite is simply much leaner than MySQL so it will use less resource on your Pi.The SQLite licence is much friendlier than MySQL.sqlite is much tighter than mySQL, and faster under many conditions too.","Taking into account the benefits of mysql (database, faster, management), it is better, but you should also take into account the advantages of sqlite: leaner, friendlier, tighter.","I have been using both for a long time and they are very different beasts. In the end, you will find that if you want to use one of them in production then it makes sense to go with MySQL. The main reason being because there is no other database out there which can do what MySQL does. You also get better performance from it. It has many more features than its competitors, but most importantly - it does not require any special hardware on your computer. If you don’t know anything about databases at all, just read this article by Stephen King (yes, he wrote it) and you’ll be able to understand why it’s so important. Which Database Should You Use? There are two types of databases: relational and non-relational. Both offer advantages over their competitors. However, some people prefer the flexibility offered by relational databases. For example, when working with large amounts of data – such as storing all the books ever written in English – a simple ORM like PostgreSQL offers much greater flexibility.","The answer to this question depends on the type of database you are using. If your application needs a high performance database, then I would recommend using MySQL. However, if you need low latency and fast response times, then choose SQLite as it has been proven time after time. In my opinion, both databases have their pros and cons. For example, in order for an app to be able to handle large amounts of data, they should use different databases. But that doesn’t mean that one will always win. Which Database Should You Use? There are many options available when choosing between two databases: relational versus non-relational. A good rule of thumb is: pick whichever gives you the best performance. This means that you can only go with one database at once. It also means that there must not be any conflicts between them. So make sure that all data sources (documents, tables, etc.) are compatible before selecting one. Conclusion 
 
 Choosing which database to use is very important because it affects how much work you do per second.","I have been using both for the last few years and they are very similar in their features. They offer a lot of features that you can use to build your own custom applications. However, there are some differences between them. One difference is how easy it is to get started with MySQL. You will need to install an additional package called mysql which provides basic database functionality. This package also comes bundled with Postgres. If you want more advanced features, then you should look at other options. For example, if you don’t care about storing data on disk, but rather just query data, you could go with MongoDB. The main advantage of this option over MySQL is its ability to store multiple rows per table. In addition, it has built-in support for multi-table indexes. It even supports different types of indexes such as primary keys (table) and secondary keys. Another important feature of MySQL is that it’s open source so anyone can contribute code improvements.","I think that the choice between these two databases has a lot to do with your needs. If you are using Postgres, then it makes sense to use MySQL. However, if you’re running on an Oracle database, then it’s probably better to go for SQLite. The reason being that there will be less overhead in terms of database management and performance. This means that, when compared to other databases, Postgres can offer significantly faster performance than most databases. In addition, because Postgres’ data model isn’t as complex as Oracle’s, its implementation should also be easier to use. Which Database Should You Use? There are many different options available today which have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, MariaDB offers more features over MySQL, but at the same time it comes with some disadvantages too. It may not be suitable for all types of applications. On top of this, MariaDB’s license agreement states that they reserve the right to change this policy at any time.","I have been using both for a long time. My main reason was that it allowed me to run multiple databases in one system and had the advantage of being able to use different database engines with it. It also has an excellent performance compared to other systems. However, there are some disadvantages as well. For example, you can only choose between two databases: Postgres, which uses InnoDB, and MongoDB. This means that if your application needs more than 2 databases, then you will need to switch back and forth from time to time, but this does not seem like too much trouble. Also, because MySQL supports many types of data types, its support for complex queries may be limited. The same goes for SQLite since it doesn’t allow any type of custom queries. You should try to avoid these problems when choosing a database. If you want to learn more, check out my article on Choosing Your Database Engine here. Which database do you use? There are several options available for running databases.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying it for. If your goal isn't getting the most out of a database, then there's no need in terms that are more important than performance and reliability (or both).","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you're using a database that's not available in the wild, it may be best for someone who wants to use an alternative approach (e-mailing them with questions about how they can get their data from Oracle).","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you're using a database that's not available in the wild, then it may be best for one of two reasons (see below). First off there are many different ways and formats we can use these databases; however if all else fails please consider adding some additional information about yourself so as more people know what they need before making an investment decision!","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying, but it's probably best if we say that the most common use case for a database in your application (and especially one which has been around since before any of these things happened) is as an interactive web server. This means using databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL with no need whatsoever to have access control over them – they're just there so people can run their applications without having anything else go through at all!","The best way to learn about the difference between them, and how they differ from one another. The following article will show you a few of these differences in terms that are useful for beginners who want to understand what's going on with their database systems (and also some more advanced ones)."
14,Smalltalk,Java,"Java is very suited to agile development - more suited in some ways than languages like Smalltalk and Ruby, as it can do more refactorings and more forms of code analysis faster.

Languages like Smalltalk and Scheme, and to a lesser degree Python, are higher order than languages like Java.Certainly Java and C# are an even worse choice than VB; since they're mediocre compromises of c-like languages with a subset of OO layered on top (but not as much as ruby/lisp/smalltalk); and are far more cumbersome than VB or Python.Huge systems have been built in Smalltalk (a whole phone company was built on it) and Rails and they scale BETTER than rigid runtimes like Java because they are more flexible.They were certainly first prototyped in Smalltalk (way easier to do than in Java). I would like to pay attention to the fact that java is For a more concrete example, writing the exact same application in Java is much cheaper than doing so in Smalltalk, because undergrad CS courses all use Java nowadays, and practically no one has ever used Smalltalk.While Java and C# might not be ""absolutely pure"" OOP-wise (e.g. they have incorporated some of the functional programming approaches), they are inherently OOP-based, they are mainstream (thus have much larger communities) and they are easier to learn than Smalltalk IMHO.While Java and C# might not be ""absolutely pure"" OOP-wise (e.g. they have incorporated some of the functional programming approaches), they are inherently OOP-based, they are mainstream (thus have much larger communities) and they are easier to learn than Smalltalk IMHO.","Taking into account the benefits of smalltalk (languages, higher, lisp), it is better. But you should know that java is: use, cheaper, easier.","I think Java has a lot of advantages over Smalltalk. The main one being that it allows you to do things in the browser without having to write any code at all. This means that if your application needs to interact with other applications on the web, then there are no special requirements for writing an app using Java. You can use whatever language and framework you want as long as it’s written by someone who knows what they’re doing. And since you’re not limited to just web browsers, there’s also nothing stopping you from building native apps for mobile devices. In fact, this could be quite useful when developing games because they don’t have to worry about compatibility issues between different platforms. Another advantage of JavaScript is its ability to run multiple processes simultaneously. For example, imagine running two websites simultaneously while working on another one. If you wanted to, you could easily create separate windows where each page displays only part of the content depending on which window was open. With JavaScript, that’s very easy to do.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a small program for fun, then Java might be better than Smalltalk. But if you want something more powerful, and especially if you have some serious business requirements, then Ruby may be better. In fact, it would probably make sense to use both languages in tandem. The main advantage of using one language over another is that, when writing code with Ruby, you can easily switch between them without having to learn new syntax. This makes Ruby's syntax much easier to learn. However, there are disadvantages as well. For example, while Ruby has many built-in features such as variables, blocks, loops, etc. which allow programmers to do things like ""print $x from stdin at %s"", it's not very easy to extend these features. Also, because Ruby uses classes instead of objects, its type system is less powerful than Java's.","The answer to this question depends on the type of language you are using. If your application uses Java and has a lot of code that needs to be executed in order for it to work, then I would say go with Java. However, if your application only requires small amounts of code, then choose Smalltalk. In fact, there are many people who prefer Smalltalk, because they find its syntax more readable than Java, which can get quite verbose at times. There are two main reasons why we chose Smalltalk: 
 
 It was designed by Dennis Ritchie – one of the founders of Unix. He also wrote C and C++, so he knows how important simplicity is. His design philosophy was: “Simplicity first, performance second.” This means that most of our applications will run faster when written using Smalltalk. We wanted to make sure that all of our users could use it. Our goal was not just to write programs but to build an entire community around them. To do this, we decided to create a new programming language, called JavaScript.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to write a small application and have it run in an environment where there will be no other applications running, then Java might be better than Smalltalk. But if your goal is to build something more complex with lots of dependencies between different parts of it, then JavaScript may be better. In my opinion, both languages are good for writing simple applications. However, they don't work well together as web development tools. The main advantage of using one language over another lies in its ability to provide a consistent interface across all components of the application. This allows developers to focus their efforts on building out the most important features rather than worrying about how many libraries they need to install. For example, when developing a website which has multiple pages (say, a blog post), each page can use only those resources needed by the current page.","I think Java has a lot of good things going for it. It is very easy to learn and it provides an excellent programming environment. However, there are some drawbacks that make me prefer Smalltalk. The main one being the lack of support for object-oriented programming. This means you cannot create objects with methods like this: 
 
 class Person { get; set; } 
 
 You can only use this method if your object implements Object.defineProperty() method. If not, then you have no way to access properties such as name, age, etc. In other words, in order to implement this, you will need to subclass from Person.class. And since classes don't inherit methods, they can’t be used outside their own classes. So what does this mean exactly? Well, when we say “class”, we’re referring to something that’s defined inside another object.","I'm not sure what to say. I think it's a good idea for small talk, but if you're going to use the language as an IDE then there are some things that need more work than just writing code and doing stuff in your head (like making calls). The best way to do this would be by using something like JUnit which has lots of features such AsyncTask, TaskRunner. In fact even though we don't have any native support on Android yet - at least with our own platform-agnostic framework called Gradle -- most developers will probably want to try out these tools first! But here comes my question... What does all those great new APIs mean when they come into play? Well let me tell ya about them :) First off one thing i'd love people who know how big java works knows where their problems lie! So lets start from scratch :) Let's take example 1... We'll create two classes named ""java"" & "".junit"".","I'm not sure. I think it's a good idea to use the term ""smalltalk"" when you're talking about small code, but if your goal isn't just writing simple and clean interfaces for other languages (like C++), then maybe there are some things that can be done with smaller-than-a-dozen tiny programs in one language instead of another! In fact this might make sense as long as we don' t have any big problems at all; however, what do they mean by 'big'? Well let's say our program has two arguments – an argument from which each side must agree on something else before proceeding further down its path…and so forth. We'll call them BigTalk.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying. If your goal was simply a simple application, then small talk would be the best way of getting started with it and if that's not possible for some reason (like because there isn't much documentation), I'd suggest using java-javac instead as well! It has many advantages over jvm but also provides more features than JVM does in terms about how things work inside its own codebase which makes writing large programs easier when working from source rather like C++11 where all functions have their place within an object/object model so they can easily get into other languages such 3rd party libraries etc.. But even though smaller talks might seem good at first glance...","The answer to this question depends on the language you are using. For example, if your application uses a lot of C++ and Python programming languages (e-mailing), then it may be easier for someone who has never used any other scripting system than an experienced programmer with no experience in JavaScript/JavaScript development would have difficulty understanding what's going wrong when they try something new! If there was some kind ""magic"" that could help them understand how things work without having written code themselves before writing their own scripts - like making sure all functions return values from function calls instead of just returning value types as expected by most programmers -- I'd love to see more people use such techniques because we can't do anything about bugs where our programs don' even know which way everything goes at runtime so why not make those tools available through libraries rather quickly too?!","I think it's a good idea to start with small talk. It can be used for things like writing code, but you don't need much of anything else besides the basics (like making sure that your program doesn't break). There are many other ways around this too; I've written about them here and there in my book on Python Programming Languages. If we're going by what people say today they'll probably call ""smalltalk"", then maybe some more interesting stuff will follow soon!"

However, if you want something more complex, and have some experience with Haskell, then it might make sense to use Haskell. In my experience, most people who learn Haskell find themselves writing code in their head rather than actually using it. This can lead them into thinking they know how to do things when really they don’t. The same thing happens for those of us who try to get better at programming. We often end up spending lots of time learning new concepts instead of getting good results. For example, one way we tend to spend our time doing programming is by reading books about computer science. But even though these books teach us many useful things, there is no guarantee that we’ll ever implement them. Most programmers don’t read books, but that’s not because they’re lazy. It’s because it’s much easier to understand theory from an abstract description like a book than through actual code.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something more than just an implementation of some language, then Java might be your best choice. However, if you’d like to do things with code and data in ways that are not possible using Java, then Haskell, which has been around since 1999, may be better suited. The first thing you’ll notice about Haskell is its syntax. It looks very similar to Java. This similarity comes at a cost, though. In particular, it makes writing programs much harder because it’s hard to write functions without having to use type annotations.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. For me, Java was just too verbose and complicated. It took me ages to learn how to use it. The same goes for Haskell. On top of that, it has some features which are not available in other languages. This makes learning Haskell much easier. However, if you’re looking for something more powerful than Java, then Scala might be better suited. If your goal is speed rather than power, then Go may also work well. Finally, there are languages like Rust which have been designed with performance as their main priority. They offer an impressive amount of power at very little cost. In my opinion, these three languages represent the best choices when choosing between them. You can choose them based on whether they fit into your development workflow better. But don’t forget about all those libraries out there, too. There are many good ones out there.

If you’re looking for something that will make your life easier, then Java might be better than Haskell.

 I have been using Java for a while and it has become my preferred language of choice. It does not require much effort to learn the language, but you will need some experience with other programming languages as well. The main reason why people choose Java over Ruby on Rails is that they can use libraries written in Java. This means that if your application needs an external library such as JsonSerializer, then you don't have to write any code yourself. You just download it, compile it into a binary file and run it. If you're writing something more complex like a web application, this may be easier than downloading all these dependencies from somewhere else. Another advantage of Java is its support for multiple languages. For example, when developing a mobile app, it's easy enough to develop both Android apps and iOS apps. However, since most developers are still stuck on Windows, there aren't many options available yet.","I've been using the language for a while now, and I'm pretty sure that it's one of my favorite. It has some nice features like lazy typing (which makes code more readable), easy to use syntax highlighting, etc., but also lots of bugs in its implementation which make writing programs very difficult if you're not careful about what your program does with them. The problem here isn't just lacklustre performance; there are many things wrong when trying out this new programming paradigm as well! In fact...it seems so much easier than ever before because we can write our own languages without having to worry too hard on how they work together - even though most people don' t know any good ways to do these kinds-of stuff yet :-)

 So why did Scala get such an early start at all?! Well first off, let's say something along those lines : ""Scala was born from necessity.""","This question has been asked many times in the past, but I think it's time to answer this one. It seems that there are two main ways of thinking about programming languages and how they work together - both have their own set-up problems which can be solved by using a different language (e., C++). The first way involves making sure you know what your program does well enough so as not to break things down into separate parts; for example if we want our code written with an interface like std::string, then all functions should return true. This means writing programs where each function returns false will make them look bad when compared against other implementations because those interfaces may fail at runtime even though some might actually do something useful! In fact most programmers would probably prefer having only three types instead since these could easily get out from under us without breaking anything else... So let me explain why my approach works best here :) First off lets say hello world!","This question has been asked many times in the past, but I've never really found it to be a good answer. It's not that there isn't some kind of language for this problem; rather, we have an idea about what languages are best suited and how they should work together (or at least as separate systems). In fact… well, if you're going with one particular approach then maybe your choice will depend on which way things go down when dealing directly between two different approaches – so let me try my hand here!","I'm not sure what the best answer to this question would be. I've been using it for a while now, and have found that there are some very interesting things about its syntax (which you can read in more detail here). It's also pretty easy on my system; if anything makes me feel like writing code with an IDE rather than just typing something out of thin air doesn't make sense at all!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a programmer, it's probably best if the language has some kind (or both) abstraction that allows for more control over what happens in code execution and how things are executed by other programmers than just writing programs themselves; otherwise there would be no need at all!"

However, groovy is not be ignored, because it is The Groovy syntax is much terser than Java, it's much easier to do things in one line of Groovy code that would take you several in Java.Groovy makes it easier to write good code faster - and as a Java developer you already know how to write Groovy code.It's based on Groovy instead of Java, but since Groovy is really close to Java, it won't be a problem (actually, it's easier than Java in many aspects) (a Grails application is actually a Java EE application) .","After much thought, I realized that  java is better, because: faster, easier, classes. But it will be useful for you to know that groovy is: terser, easier to write good code faster, problem.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a language. If you're looking for something more powerful than Java, then Java might be better. But if your goal is just to write some simple web applications, then Ruby and Python are probably better choices. The main difference between these two languages lies in their syntax. Both of them have syntax similar to JavaScript, but they differ significantly when it comes to how code works. In Ruby, everything works with blocks, while in Python, everything operates as functions. This means that, unlike JavaScript where functions can take any number of arguments, Ruby's blocks cannot accept variables. Instead, every block has an associated function which takes one argument.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what kind of developer you are. If you’re a beginner and want to learn how to write code in JavaScript, then Java might be better for you. But if you’re more advanced and are looking for something with which to build your own web application, then JavaScript will probably suit you better. The main reason why people choose one over another is because they have different reasons for choosing it. For example, when it comes to building an application using Java, there are many things that can go wrong. You need to know about JSP, Servlets, EJB, etc. And even though these technologies were created by some very talented people, it’s not always easy to get them working together properly. This makes developing applications much harder. On top of that, there’s also the fact that most developers don’t use any other language besides Java. So they’re stuck writing their code in Java. In contrast, Groovy, while being based on Python, has been designed from scratch specifically for Web development. It uses Python as its primary programming language.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want your application to do. If you’re building a web application, then Java will be fine. However, if you’re developing an app that needs to do some heavy lifting in order for it to function properly, then you’ll probably prefer Groovy. The reason being that there are more libraries available and they have better support for common problems. For example, when using Json.parse with jOOQ, it’s much easier to use than with other frameworks such as Spring. Also, since most of these problems can be solved by just adding one line to the code, there’s less need to write code that’s optimized for each individual case. This means that writing complex applications becomes easier. Another advantage of having a single language like Scala versus Java, which has many different implementations, is that you don’t have to worry about compatibility issues. You only have to make sure that all the classes conform to the same API so that everything works together.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is a high performance web application that can handle large amounts of traffic, then Java will be the better choice. However, if you want something more lightweight, and have limited resources, then Ruby may be better. In either case, I would suggest using both languages in tandem. You should also consider which language best fits your specific needs at any given time. For example, if you need an extremely fast database backend for your application, but don’t know how to write it yourself, then use Ruby. But if you’re looking for a lightweight framework with great performance, choose Java. Conclusion

 Syria Says It Will Not Let U.N.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write code in a language which will be easy for others to understand, then Java and Scala might seem like good choices. However, if you want to build something more complex than that, such as an application server, then Ruby may be better suited. The main reason why it seems so appealing is because of its simplicity. It does not require any special knowledge about how computers work at all. You can even start writing applications without knowing anything about computers. This makes it very attractive when building web applications. For example, here is some code from my blog post “Building A Web Application With Rails”. In order to make our app work, we need two things: a database table with all information needed by the application, and a way to access it. We also have to create three different views (models, views, controllers) each one representing a specific type of data (for example User has a user model, User model contains a list of users, etc).","The answer to this question depends on the language you are using. If your code doesn't compile, it will not be able for some reason (e-mailing me with a bug report). You can use any of these languages and they all work fine together in one place!","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying. If your goal has been a simple, easy-touse web application that can be used in any language and run anywhere with no configuration required (e., without having to worry about the dependencies of other languages), then it's probably best for me not to write anything at all!","I'm not sure. I think it's a good choice for the job, but you can't really say that with Scala and Clojure because they're both very similar languages (and if your language isn't one of them then what are we doing here?). But there seems to be some similarity between these two programming paradigms in terms about how things work together – which makes me wonder whether this may have something at all going on behind closed doors when writing code like ""let mut foo = bar"". Or maybe just having an open source project where people write their own libraries instead of using JVM-like frameworks such as Go!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal seems obvious, then it's probably because the language has been around for a long time and there are many different ways of writing code that make sense in practice (e-mailing someone with an idea about how they should write something). But if not enough people have already written some good JavaScript libraries before now, why bother learning more languages when we can learn them from scratch by using other tools like JSFiddle? And maybe even just use one!","The first thing you need to know about the language, and how it works. It's a very simple programming paradigm that allows for many different kinds of languages (including JavaScript) with their own syntax tree structure; in this case we'll use Scala as our example project so I won't go into details on its features but suffice it here). The main difference between these two approaches are not only they both have some common core concepts like type safety etc., which makes them easier than any other approach because there isn'nt much code involved at all! So let me explain what each one does best by showing us an overview from scratch using JVM 2."
17,Java,Lisp,"Java can be verbose compared to languages like lisp and python.
LISP is a language that has fallen behind, in terms of popularity compared to other languages like Python, PERL, C, and Java.
We do not want another Lisp (because we would use Clojure then) but a language for the same target audience as Java.","Compare this to languages such as Python, Ruby, and Java, which have a standard ways of handling networking and the web and you can see why developers might think that Lisp is somewhat lacking in this area.

""the programmable programming language""... ... since it may be a while before I know Lisp enough to be able to find ... software than your current large team of idiot Java programmers.Some, such as OCaml and Common LISP, can potentially be far faster than JAVA, especially at compute-intensive tasks.LISP is older than C++, Java, or C# yet actually contains several concepts that are actually more ""modern"". However, java has pluses too. It is interesting to analyze exactly why the Java version is longer than the Lisp version.So he goes to Google because they have some LISP guys there (not using LISP -- just smart guys) -- and then he gets told to do the first Java project.I'm having a hard time understanding how Java is simpler than LISP.","It's simple! lisp is better, because: emacs, programmers, faster. Yet, java should also be noticed for it is: longer, guys, simpler.","I think Lisp has a lot of advantages. It allows you to write code that can be compiled and run on any machine with the same syntax. The syntax for programming in Lisp is very similar to what it was like writing programs in Java. This means that if your program needs to do something more complex than just print out some numbers then there are no surprises when compiling it. And since all functions have their own return value this makes debugging much easier. In addition, as long as you don’t change anything else about your program, it’s easy to port it over into other languages. For example, Python uses Common Lisp which also supports object-oriented programming. So porting an existing application written in C would not require rewriting everything from scratch. Another advantage of Lisp is its support for macros. You can define macros by defining them inside functions. These allow you to create new types without having to re-invent the wheel. It’s possible to use these macros within normal code.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. For me, Lisp has been my favorite language for many years. It was easy and fun to learn but it also had some great features that made me feel like I could do anything. In fact, if I were forced to choose between Python and Java, I’d probably go with Python. But in general, it’s hard to say which one would be better than another. The only thing I’ve found consistent about all of them is their ability to make writing code more fun. If you’re looking for something that’s going to help you write code, then JavaScript might not be your best choice. And even then, there are plenty of other languages out there. So how does this compare to Java? Well, let’s start by comparing two different ways of doing things. One way is to use an IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans. This way, you’ll have access to everything needed to develop software using JavaScript. Another option is to just type commands into the command line.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to accomplish with your program. If it is a simple program that does one thing and has no dependencies, then Lisp will be better. But if there is more than one way of doing something, then Python may be better for you. In any case, try both languages out before making up your mind. You can always return to my article about which language is best in another article. The main reason why people choose Ruby over Python is because they have been using them since their first programming days. This means that most programmers who use these two languages already know how to write programs in them. However, even though many developers learn by writing code, not all of us actually do that. Most of us, however, just read code snippets from other people’s code. We don’t really understand it, so we start coding without knowing anything at all. It turns out, though, that learning something new doesn’t mean having to reinvent the wheel. There are plenty of existing libraries available for Python, Ruby, Java, etc.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is to write a program in Lisp and then run it on an operating system with no other programming languages installed, then Lisp will be better than Java. But if you want to do something more complex, like build a web application using Ruby (or Python), then Lisp may not be as good for you. In fact, there have been many times when I've wanted to use Python but couldn't because of its lack of support for Common Lisp. This was especially true after learning about Python's garbage collection which made my code much slower. So while it's possible to get by without Java, it's also important to understand why some people prefer one language over another. The main reason I chose Lisp is that it has very few features that can easily be implemented in Ruby. For example, most programmers would agree that JavaScript doesn't really need any kind of object model at all. However, since JavaScript uses callbacks instead of objects, objects aren't available anywhere near as easily.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a program that does something useful and not too hard then Lisp will be fine.

I've always been a big fan of the C language, but it's hard to find an example that makes me feel like this isn't what you're looking for in your project (or at least something close).","I've been using Clojure for a while now, and I'm not sure what it's like to be able write code that works in the language. But there are some things about this programming environment which make me think of writing programs as something more than just an ordinary computer program (or at least one with no special features). For example you can't use any kind ""programming"" tool because your compiler will ignore all other tools available on Unix/Linux platforms such Assembler, C++11. You have to rely upon libraries from outside sources instead of relying solely onto them yourself; if they're missing then their performance becomes even worse! This makes sense when we consider how many different languages people actually need out of every single platform – but also why do so few programmers ever get around to doing anything else?!","The answer to this question can be found in the following article. The main difference between these two languages are that they both have a single language called JVM, which means it's written entirely on top of an interpreter (JIT). This makes them very similar and allows you access to all your code without having to write anything into any other program! In fact, if I were writing my own application for example using ClojureScript then there would not be much need whatsoever as we could just use our existing libraries from within their respective programs instead of needing another one like C#. However, since most people don't know about JavaScript at first glance what kind will work best with JS/CLI? Well here comes Javascript : It has been used extensively by many developers over the years but its popularity was only recently gaining traction because some companies started making more efficient uses out-of‐the box such things being done through plugins rather than directly running scripts themselves!","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying. If your goal was simply for a simple, easy-touse programming language that could be used in any situation (e., an application), then the best choice would have been Clojure and Scala as well! However if it's more of a learning experience than just using one tool at once with no real need/benefit comparison between them I'd say they're probably not worth pursuing over another two years' time. The reason why these languages aren't really great yet isn´t because there wasn`nt enough code available so far but rather due their lack thereof :). I think we can all agree about how much work has gone into making our own tools like Jekyll, Maven etc... It seems pretty obvious now when looking back where many people started out thinking ""why bother?""."

In addition, while they’re great at building websites, they aren’t very good at creating mobile apps.

 In order to create an interactive website, you need two things: A website server (hosting) and a browser (the browser). You cannot do this without both of these.

I've written about it here before in my blog post How NotToLearnProgramming. The other thing that's important with these types of questions are whether there was any kind-of code generation process involved when writing them yourself; if so, which ones were generated from scratch as well!

The only downside of this approach would be if you're using Apache 2 which has some issues when running in production environments like Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 where there are many different versions available at various times per day depending upon how much time they have left before their servers start up again!","This question has been asked many times before, but I think it's time to answer this one. The best way to get started with the language and its syntax are by using a few simple examples that you can learn from other programmers who have used similar languages in their own projects (e-mailing me at jonathan@pypi). If there was ever an example of how programming should be done without having any knowledge of C++/C# then these would probably help us understand what we're doing here!"
19,Python,Bash,"And it is much easier to run commands in bash than languages like C, python, java, perl, etc..
Point is: Python is the number one scripting language (after bash) for sysadmins just like Perl used to be.
Here are a few reasons why I chose to write scripts in bash instead of perl or python or some other scripting language: .","Bash is a scripting language, PHP, Python, ASP etc aren't.
My roommate likes Bash for his scripting needs but I think Python is a better glue language.
Because BASH has limited flexibility (compared to scripting languages like Perl and Python) it forces you to only use it to write very simple programs.","And it is much easier to run commands in bash than languages like C, python, java, perl, etc..
Point is: Python is the number one scripting language (after bash) for sysadmins just like Perl used to be.
Here are a few reasons why I chose to write scripts in bash instead of perl or python or some other scripting language: .","After much thought, I realized that  python is better. My skills in bash scripting are very limited, and even worse in Python.Python is faster than bash usually, so I think I'll just adjust it.Python is about 80% faster than bash because it is byte compiled while base is interperated.Not sure what the ""other things"" were :) Opinions may differ, but I think 1 parameterized python script is a little cleaner than 2 bash scripts. But bash is Bash : sometimes it's easier to write a script in bash rather than in python.Bash : sometimes it's easier to write a script in bash rather than in python.Ordinarily, I'd do this using a scripting language like Python but it is possible, although harder, to do it using a bash script and curl.","Looks like python is better, because: kill, faster, base. But it will be useful for you to know that bash is: easier to write a script in bash rather, easier, language.","I have to say that the choice of language for a beginner should be based on what they are going to use in their day-to-day work. If you want to learn Python, then go with Python. But if you just need something simple and fast like Bash (or even Perl) then Go will do fine. The only thing which might make it difficult would be the fact that there isn’t much documentation about it. You can find some tutorials online but not much. There aren’t any good books written by people who know Go. So it’s up to you. As far as learning goes, my advice is: start small. Start small because that’s where you’ll get your first experience with. Don’t try to become an expert at one language. Just keep learning. You’ll eventually reach a point when you’re comfortable enough with the basics so that you don’t feel intimidated anymore. Then move onto more advanced topics until you’ve mastered them. It’s important to remember that every new skill comes from experience. And this means that you can’t expect to master everything right away.","I have been using Bash for a long time and it has always worked well on my Linux boxes. But recently the distribution of bash packages was changed to be based on Debian unstable. This means that there are no more package managers like apt-get which were used by many users in the past. The only way to install new versions of python libraries such as numpy is via pip installer. And this requires installing all dependencies manually. So what should you do? Should you use python-devel instead? Or do you need something else? Let’s find out. Installing python3 with debootstrap 
 
 If you want to try out PyPy without having to download any packages, then it’s better to install python3-dev from here. You can also install the latest version of python, but if you’re not sure about that, just run./configure && make install. Then you’ll see “python3” listed under your PATH variable. Now let’s create our first project.","The answer to this question depends on your use case. If you are writing a web application that needs lots of data and processing power, then the choice between Bash and Python will be obvious. But if you’re using it for some other purpose, such as an embedded system, where performance isn’t critical, then there may not be much difference in performance. In fact, I would say that both languages have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, while Bash has many built-in functions which can help speed up processing, they don’t always work well with certain types of data. On the other hand, Python offers several libraries which make it easy to write custom functions. This makes it easier to get started quickly. However, these features also come at a cost. You need to know how to install them properly so that they work. And even when they’re installed, sometimes they won’t run correctly because they depend on external libraries. To solve this, you’ll want to read my article about installing Python. Which language should I learn?","I have been using Bash for a long time and it has become my preferred shell because of its simplicity and speed. However, there are many other options that can be used to accomplish the same task. For example, you could use bash on Windows if your computer supports it. If not, then you should consider learning Python. The following article will explain how to install python in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with no additional effort. Installing Python In Ubuntu: How To Do It Yourself 
 
 There are two ways to install python: either by downloading an ISO file from pypi.org, which takes some time, or installing via apt-get. Both methods require root access so make sure you’re not running as root. You need to know what kind of environment you’re working in. Let’s take a look at each method. Download PyPI Package Manager (PyPI) 
 
 This method requires less than 10 minutes to download all necessary packages and configure them properly. Once installed, you’ll see a list of available packages.","I think that the best way to answer this question would be by asking a different question: what language should you learn first? If you have already learned Python, then it makes sense to go with Bash. However, if you’re new to programming, and want to get started quickly, Bash might not be your first choice. The reason for this is simple: there are many other languages out there. For example, Ruby has Rails, which can help you start programming in Ruby. But even though it’s an excellent language, you’ll still need some experience before learning it. And while JavaScript may seem like a good choice because of its popularity, there’s also Node.js. You could try Ruby, but chances are, it’ll take more time than you’d like. So let’s say that you don’t know much about programming. How do you choose between these two languages? Well, here are my top three recommendations: 
 
 Python: It’s fast, easy to learn, and will save you time. It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been programmering, as soon as you pick up Python you’ll feel at home.",I'm not sure if I can say that.,"This question was asked by a reader on Reddit. I think it's fair to say that, for the most part at least, there are two options out of three (Python and Bash). The first one has been around since 2008 when we started using python in our projects as well; however, this time you can use any language other than C++ if your project needs some help with things like file system accesses etc., so long after all these years have passed where people still don't understand what they're doing!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't just a simple shell, then it's probably best for the rest of us as well! But if we want more control over our code and less time spent debugging (and maybe even some sanity checking), there are many ways that can be done with bash scripts in general.","I'm not sure if I can say for certain that the best way to use this library in a production environment, but it's certainly one of my favorite libraries. It has been used by many developers and designers who have worked with Ruby on Rails over time (and even more recently) as well! The reason why you should be using these tools instead are twofold; firstly, they allow us all access into our codebase without having any real constraints about what we're doing at runtime – which means there isn't much overhead when working from source files like your own projects/files etc… Secondly though … how do people get started building their applications within an IDE?","I've been using the latest version of python for a while now, and it's always great to get some new features. I'm not sure if there are any other languages that can do this work as well (Python 2 has an API called ""python-cli"", which allows you install packages from source), but here we go! If your language supports both bash commands in addition - then yes please use them :-) In my case though, when installing these tools on Linux/Mac OS X they're all installed with pip, so no need to worry about installation manually :) The only thing missing was one command line tool named pkg_installer. It does what its name implies; however most people will find themselves needing more than just PAMs..."

Maintaining Python code is easier than maintaining Perl, but using Perl modules is often easier than using Python modules because Perl developers are kinda forced to explain their work.Thus python code is easier to maintain than Perl.implementation language, Python is much easier to learn than Perl. But you should also take into account the advantages of perl. Perl is faster than Python for many tasks.I wud want to say this: 1) Perl is faster than python 2) Perl is uglier than python 3) Python is a crap of ideas thrown in irregular fashion.Perl, in fact, has much stronger OO than Python.","python is superior as it is: easier, developers, modules. I would like to pay attention to the fact that perl is : faster, uglier, stronger.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something more than just an interpreter and some basic data structures, then Perl might be better suited. However, if your goal is to write code in Python, then Perl, as its name suggests, will probably suit you. In fact, it may even make sense to use both languages at once. The reason being that, while they are very similar, there are many differences between them. For example, when writing programs with Python, one can easily see how things like loops, conditionals, etc. work by using the module system. This makes them easier to understand and use. On the other hand, when working with perl code, it’s much harder to tell what’s going on. One has to rely heavily on the documentation of modules and functions. While these help a lot, they’re not always enough. Another difference is that python allows you to define functions which return values without having to worry about side effects. This means that you don’t have to care whether any function returns null or not.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want your language to be and how much time you have available. If you’re looking for a quick way of getting something done, then Perl might be better than Python, but if you’re more interested in learning about programming languages as an art form with some practical applications (web development, data analysis, etc. ), then Python will probably win out. The best thing about using both languages at the same time, however, is that they are very similar when it comes to syntax. Both languages share many common features, such as: 
 
 A lot of code can fit into one line of code. This makes writing small programs easier because it’s not necessary to write lots of lines just to get a single result. You don’t need any special syntax to do simple things like print out a string from stdin. In fact, most people who use either language would find it easy enough to learn Python. There isn’t really anything wrong with having two different languages.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to write a web application and have it run in one of these languages, then Perl might be better than Python. But if you want to build something that runs across multiple operating systems, such as an embedded system, then Python will probably win out. The best way for me to explain why I like both languages is by using some examples from my own experience. In particular, I'll use Ruby code snippets which illustrate how they work together. This example shows how to create a simple HTTP server with Ruby. It uses Ruby's standard library HTTP::Server. You can see that all requests go through two separate processes, each running its own server. One process handles incoming requests, while another processes outgoing requests. These two processes communicate over TCP, so there isn't any need for a third process. To make things even more interesting, let's say we wanted to add support for sending email messages via email.","I think that the answer depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to write a few lines of code and get it working, then Perl will be fine. But if you want to do something more complex, like writing an application for a web site, then you'll need Perl. The main reason why people use both languages is because they have similar syntax. Both can take advantage of Python's standard library features. For example, in Python, functions return values from their enclosing function body. In Perl, this happens by calling the ""with"" statement at the end of each function. This allows us to pass arguments into functions, which we would otherwise not be able to. Another thing about syntax similarity between these two languages is that there aren't many differences when it comes to how variables work. You don't really need to know anything special about them - all that's needed is knowing where they are. One other difference is that, while Python has built-in support for variables, perl doesn't. So it's easier to work with variables.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do with your code. If you want a language for writing web applications, then Perl will be fine. But if you need something more powerful than that, and have some experience in other languages, then Python might be better. In fact, it may even be better than Perl. For example, there was an interesting discussion about whether Ruby should replace PHP as the scripting language. It turned out that most of the people who were involved thought that Ruby would not make much difference at all. However, one person said he had written code which used Ruby because it made his life easier. Another said, “I don’t know how many times I’ve needed to write a script but couldn’t find any way to get my program running without using PHP.” The point is, we can all agree that having a good tool makes our lives easier when doing something, so why shouldn’t we use it? There are two main reasons why I prefer Python. First, it’s easy to learn. Second, it’s fast.","The answer to this question depends on which language you're using. If your code doesn't use the same syntax, it's probably not a good idea for Ruby and PHP at all! The best way to learn how languages work in general can be found here.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying it at. If your goal in life was simply writing code that works, then I would recommend using a language like C++ instead of Java and Ruby (or even PHP). However if you want more flexibility with how the program runs than just one programming style for each platform can be achieved by building an entire application from scratch rather quickly!","The answer to this question comes down to two things. First, it's a good idea for programmers and developers alike to learn about the language in an open-source way (e.-g., by using PyPy). Second — as I've said before, there are many languages that can be used with python without having any knowledge of how they work; however much you know will depend on your experience working within them at all times.","I'm not sure what the best way to describe this question, but I think it's a good one. In my opinion there are two main reasons for using python and perl in your codebase (and some other languages). First of all you need to know how they work so that people can understand them well enough without having any trouble with their syntax errors when trying different ways of writing things on top-level platforms like C++11/12 etc. Secondly if someone wants to learn about programming language concepts then go ahead! You'll be surprised at just HOW many times these topics have been covered by others who've written similar articles as me - especially those from beginners such Asperger syndrome, which means no more learning anything new than basic arithmetic.","I'm not sure. I've read a lot of articles about how to write code in C++, but it's hard for me to find any good examples on the topic (or even if you're interested)."
21,Eclipse,NetBeans,"Eclipse IDE (worked better for us than NetBeans) .

NetBeans shuts down WAY faster than Eclipse.Besides, OOTB, NetBeans is far easier to use than Eclipse.In my opinion, NetBeans is far easier to use than Eclipse.Finally, blogger JJ Behrens, who has been using NetBeans for six months, noted that NetBeans is ""way easier to get up to speed with than Eclipse."" On the other side, eclipse is Eclipse has MUCH smarter Java Editor than Netbeans, I think this should be the main task Netbeans should perform in the near future!The sun should accept that Eclipse has retained better position than netbeans, so merge netbeans team with eclipse team that's it.The answer should be Eclipse because it is simpler ""out of the box"" than NetBeans.","I am prone to choose netbeans, because: faster, easier to use, easier. But i should tell you that eclipse is: smarter, position, simpler.","I have been using both for a long time, and the only reason why I switched to NetBeans was because of its excellent IDE support. It has also become very popular with Java developers as it offers many features that are missing in Eclipse. For example, you can use code completion on your code, which makes debugging much easier. Also, there is no need to install any additional libraries such as JPA or Hibernate since they all come bundled into one package. The other thing about NetBeans is that it comes pre-installed with IntelliJ IDEA so if you want to develop applications without having to learn another programming language, then this will be an advantage over Eclipse, but not by much. There are some disadvantages too, like the fact that you cannot easily create new projects from scratch, although you could do it. You would still have to go through several steps before creating something new. Another disadvantage is that you can’t add custom classes to existing projects, even though you could do so.","I am not sure which one to choose. The main reason for choosing Eclipse over NetBeans was the fact that it has a lot of plugins and can be used as an IDE in addition to being able to create your own custom code with it. It also comes with many other features such as: 
 
 Code completion (IntelliJ) 
 
 Syntax highlighting (Intellisense) 
 
 Automatic indentation (CodeComplete) 
 
 Java 8 support (JDK 7) 
 
 JUnit 5 integration 
 
 And much more. If you are looking for something more than just a simple IDE, then choose Eclipse. You will get all these features, plus more, at no extra cost. Conclusion 
 
 In this article, we have discussed about how to install Maven on Windows 10 using Visual Studio Code. We have seen some useful tips regarding installing Maven, but most importantly, we learned how to use it effectively when developing applications for Windows. This article covers those topics very well.","I have been using both for a long time and they are very similar in their features. The main difference between them is that the latter has more features than Eclipse. For example, you can use it to create your own custom Java EE application with JSF 2.3 and Hibernate support. You also get much better performance compared to other web frameworks like Spring Boot. However, there are some disadvantages of using either one. If you’re looking at switching from one framework to another, here are my top 3 reasons why you should choose JetBrains. 1. It supports multiple versions of Java. This means that if you want to develop an app on Android but not iOS, you’ll be able to. It’s even possible to build apps targeting different platforms without any problems. 2. It provides support for building applications with many components. In fact, it’s so good that you don’t need to worry about how things will work when you start adding new components because all those dependencies are automatically handled by the framework. 3.","I am not a big fan of the Java EE specification. It has been around for quite some time and it was developed by many different companies with very little collaboration between them. The current version of JBoss 8 is based on this specification but there are still several issues that need to be addressed. One such issue is how do you deal with multiple versions of your application in one single application. This can lead to problems if an update breaks something else which depends on it. Another problem is that most developers don’t know about these issues. If they did, then maybe we could have avoided all those bugs from being introduced into our applications. There are also other reasons why people prefer another framework. For example, when working with large applications like web applications, it’s often easier to use frameworks than building them yourself. Also, as mentioned above, sometimes using libraries makes things easier. In addition, because of their flexibility, frameworks allow us to build complex systems without worrying too much about performance. Finally, since they’re open source, there’s no reason to worry about security vulnerabilities either.","I have been using both for a while and they are very similar in their features. However, the main difference between them is that NetBeans has more features than Eclipse. It also supports multiple languages which makes it easier to develop applications with it. Also, you can use Java 8 directly from within Netbeans. This means that if your application needs some extra functionality, then you don’t need to go through the hassle of installing an additional IDE just to get that. You will be able to start developing right away without any problems. Which one should I choose? If you’re looking for something simple, but powerful, then definitely choose NetBeans. It’s easy to use, it’s fast, and there isn’t anything else out there. But if you want something more, like integration with other tools such as JBoss EAP 7, then you’ll probably end up choosing Eclipse, because that’s what most developers use. Conclusion 
 
 There really aren’t many choices when it comes to web development tools.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your project has a lot of code, it's probably best not use the eclipse-netbeans package because that will be much more expensive than using netbean. However if you have lots of data and are looking for an easy way to integrate with other projects (like web development), then I'd suggest adding some dependencies like java, maven dependency tree etc...","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying. If your goal was just a simple web application, then it would be fine with the eclipse browser as well (it's not that different from Chrome).","In the past, I've written about how to use Java in a more efficient way.","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. If you're a Java developer, it's probably not worth the effort of trying out an IDE like java-netbeans for Android and iOS development because there are so many different ways that developers can use their code in both platforms without having any experience with them yet. However if you want to learn more about how web frameworks work then I'd recommend reading my article ""JavaScript as HTML5"" by Eric Kripke which covers some basic concepts such AsyncWebRequest, WebSocketConnection.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the past, it was difficult for me and many others to find an ideal solution that worked well with my current project (I'm currently working on another one). I've tried different approaches but none of them have really made any difference in terms from what we're seeing now!"
22,CUDA,OpenCL,"I also think that NVidia compute apps generally run a lot faster in CUDA mode than OpenCL.
Nvidia released its OpenCL driver and SDK to developers, the company's new ""heterogeneous"" computing environment that runs on the CUDA architecture.
It has ATI GPUs which don't support CUDA, the proprietary nVidia technology which Adobe uses instead of OpenCL.","I'm not used to CS6, but if it uses openCL rather than CUDA, you'll want an AMD video card instead of a nVidia.
Workstation users might find themselves using applications which only use CUDA, though there is no reason why software developers should not support open standards as well (OpenCL) supported by both AMD and Nvidia.","It has ATI GPUs which don't support CUDA, the proprietary nVidia technology which Adobe uses instead of OpenCL.
I'm not used to CS6, but if it uses openCL rather than CUDA, you'll want an AMD video card instead of a nVidia.
I'm not used to CS6, but if it uses openCL rather than CUDA, you'll want an AMD video card instead of a nVidia.","It's simple! opencl is better. We want to squeeze every last bit of performance out of our products and computers' hardware, and that's the real reason we'll be staying with CUDA for as long as it's supported - or until OpenCL offers performance that can match that of CUDA.AMD's openCL is easier to program for than CUDA as well.First there were CUDA-accelerated transcoding programs, then NVIDIA and AMD supported ones and finally we are getting into OpenCL development down the same road. But you should know that cuda is And with the current state of Windows' OpenCL drivers, the fastest AMD GPU in the OpenCL-enabled MPE GPU-acceleration mode would still have performed slower than an NVIDIA CUDA GPU that costs half as much money in the CUDA-specific MPE GPU acceleration mode.While it will offend some that Google continues to be investing in NVIDIA's CUDA GPGPU language rather than an open standard like OpenCL, the Google engineers continue making progress on a speedy, open-source CUDA with LLVM.A GPGPU programmer will find this CUDA version a lot easier to use than OpenCL, so NVIDIA is doing a good job here.","It's a hard decision but I choose opencl. Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: offers, support, performance. However, cuda is not be ignored, because it is: money, nda, easier to use.","The answer to this question depends on your use case. If you are building a game engine that will be used for many years and need the best performance out of your GPU, then I would go with OpenCL because it has better support in terms of hardware acceleration than CUDA; however, if you want something more portable, then OpenCL might work better. In my case, I’m using an Intel NUC which runs Ubuntu 14.04 LTS so it’s not really possible to run both at once. However, there are some workarounds available such as running one application inside another application. For example, when compiling C++ code into native code, we can compile the compiled code first before loading it. This way we get faster compilation times but also have access to all the optimizations provided by the compiler. Conclusion 
 
 There are several ways to achieve high performance. One of them is to optimize your code. Another option is to write optimized code yourself. And last but certainly not least, try different optimization techniques until you find what works best.","The answer to this question depends on the type of application you are working on. If your app has a lot of data and requires high performance in order for it to be useful, then I would go with OpenCL because it’s open source and can easily integrate into existing applications. However, if you’re developing an online game that only needs low latency access from one computer to another, then I’d choose CUDA. This article will explain why we chose CUDA over OpenCL, but first let’s look at some benchmarks. Benchmarks 
 
 As mentioned earlier, there were three benchmark tests used in our tests: 
 
 A simple 2D physics simulation using OpenGL ES 2.0 (Intel i5 2500K) running on Windows 7 64-bit 
 
 An image processing test using OpenCV 2.4.10 (GNU GCC/Clang) running on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 
 
 We also ran these two games through 3DMark Vantage v1.0, which measures how well each engine performs when rendering 3D images rendered by different graphics cards.","The answer to this question depends on your workload. If you are doing a lot of parallel processing, then the choice between CUDA and OpenGL will be obvious. However, if you’re working with small amounts of data in parallel, then OpenCL may make more sense. In that case, we recommend using OpenCL, because it has better performance than CUDA. For example, here is an example from our recent blog post about how to use OpenCL for deep learning applications. This code uses two GPUs running at different clock speeds (1000 MHz each) as well as one CPU core per GPU to perform convolutions. We used a single thread to run all these calculations since there was no need to do any kind of synchronization between them. Conclusion 
 
 As I said before, it’s not always easy to choose which technology to use. There are many factors involved when choosing what algorithm to use, but most importantly, you should try to avoid making decisions based solely on price.","The answer to that question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is to write a program for scientific computing, then the choice of programming language will be important. For example, if you want to use an open source library like NumPy, it makes sense to go with C. However, if you need something more powerful, such as GPU accelerated code, and have some experience in C, C++, Fortran, Ada, etc. Then OpenCL may make sense. In this case, I would recommend using C++. It has been my experience that C++ programmers tend not to get hung up about things they don’t understand. They can usually figure out how to do something, even when it’s hard. This means that there should be no surprises when writing code for GPUs. Conclusion 
 
 As we mentioned earlier, one thing that many people overlook when talking about parallel computing is performance. While performance isn’t everything, it does help us understand why programs run slowly. We also often forget that parallelism is just another way of saying parallelism.","The answer to this question depends on the type of application you are working on. If your app requires a lot of GPU compute power, then it makes sense for OpenCL because it can be used with GPUs that have much higher clock speeds than those in most consumer grade graphics cards. However, if your app only needs some basic processing power and does not require high clockspeeds, then using CUDA will give you better performance. In either case, however, there should always be an option available when developing applications which don't need very intensive computations. Which version of CUDA is best suited for my application? There are two versions of CUDA, one based on the latest release (version 4.7.0) and another based on the previous release, version 3.6.0. Both offer similar performance but different features. For example, the new version has support for multiple cores while older versions did not. This means that newer devices such as tablets may run faster than their predecessors.","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. The main difference between the two approaches are that in both cases you can use a single GPU and have multiple GPUs running at once, which means there's no need for any of them all being connected simultaneously (or even just one). In fact, it would be nice if we could combine some compute power into each CPU so as not only do they run faster but also their cores will get more efficient when combined with other CPUs! This way our system won't require too much memory bandwidth because most applications don' t care about how many threads per processor; instead what matters now was whether I had enough RAM available while using my computer - something like 1GB/s = 2x performance increase over an Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4GHz! It seems clear from reading these numbers though...","The answer to this question depends on how you define it. In general, the best way to describe a program that uses C++11's standard library (C++) and OpenGL ES 3D graphics APIs are as follows: The application must be able to run in both DirectX 11-compatible platforms such GPU Boost 2.0+ with support for Direct3d 9+, DX12+. This means using an API like GLX2 which supports all of these features but does not require any additional hardware drivers at runtime; if your app requires some extra performance from its CPU then use Vulkan instead!","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. The best way to learn about the various technologies and techniques that are available in C++, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc., has been through a series of articles by my colleague David Karpeles (http://www-davidkarapels.com).","A lot of people have asked me this question. I think it's important to understand that there are two different ways you can do things in a language like C++, and one way requires some kind (or at least an understanding) of the underlying architecture for your application code. The other approach involves using tools such as Visual Studio Code which allows developers with little knowledge of programming languages to write their own programs without having any experience working on them themselves – but not necessarily knowing what they're doing!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. In general, the best way to learn about open-source software development and how it can be used for good will come from working with other developers who have similar interests in programming languages like C++ (or Java). The more you know what a language does, then there's no need not only to work out its syntax but also understand why that particular code works well together as an application framework when compared against others such ""open source"" frameworks which are often written by people whose expertise includes writing web applications using Python. This means learning something new every day while still having fun doing so!"

But you should also take into account the advantages of oracle. Oracle is much versatile than MySQL.So if you use oracle more often than mysql, make the oracle DBPool larger.","I advise choosing mysql, for it is superior in the following aspects: faster. Yet, oracle should also be noticed for it is: versatile, larger.","I think Oracle has a lot of advantages over MySQL. For example, the database engine in Oracle is written by Sun and it runs on all major operating systems. The other advantage that Oracle has is its open source nature. You can download their software for free from their website. Also, they have an excellent customer support team. If you are not satisfied with your product, there will be no problem to get help from them. This makes them very attractive as a choice when choosing a database. However, if you want to choose one database, then go ahead and use either MySQL or Oracle. There are many benefits of using both databases but which one would you choose? Which Database Should Be Used In Your Business? It depends upon what kind of business you’re running. Some businesses may need more than just basic data storage. They might also require some sort of analytical capabilities. These kinds of companies should consider MySQL because it’s easy to install and use. Other types of businesses could benefit from another type of database such as Postgres.","I have been using Oracle for a long time and it has always worked well with my needs. It was the first database that I used in production at work so I am familiar with it. But when you are working on your own project then there is no other choice. You need to know what kind of performance you can get out of this database. If you want to use MySQL, then go ahead but if not, don’t waste your time. The only thing that matters here is performance. And as far as I’m concerned, Oracle does not deliver that. So how do we fix it? Well, let’s start by looking into some benchmarks. There are many tools available which will give us an idea about our workload. We should also look into different databases such as MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra etc. These all provide great performance, especially for small projects. Let’s see how they stack up against each other. Benchmark #1 – MySQL vs PostgreSQL 
 
 This benchmark shows just how much faster MySQL is.","I have been using Oracle for a long time and it has always worked well with my needs. However, the last few years there are many new features that make me think about switching to another database system. For example, in order to use SQLAlchemy you need to install an additional package called sqlalchemy. This makes sense because this will be used by developers who want to work on other databases besides Oracle. But what if someone wants to develop their own database? How do they go about doing that? Well, first of all, they can create a project from scratch which uses one of these two databases. The second option would be to build a custom version of SQLAlchemy, but then again how does this help them when building their application? They could just copy the code into their application as is. In fact, since most people don’t know much about databases, it’s not surprising that some developers prefer to stick with the default database. So why should we choose between them? Let’s take a look at both options.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is performance, then Oracle will be a better choice. However, if you want to do some serious data analysis, and have an eye for design, then MySQL, especially with its open source nature, may be more suitable. The main reason why MySQL seems so popular in enterprise environments today is because it offers many of the features which make PostgreSQL look like a dinosaur. For example, Postgres has no built-in support for multiple tables; MySQL does. It also allows users to create custom tables from scratch using any number of different schemas. This means that, unlike most other database systems, there really isn’t anything stopping people who don’t know how databases work from creating their own tables. And as far as design goes, it’s not hard at all to write code that can handle complex queries without resorting to complicated table layouts.","I think Oracle has a lot of advantages over MySQL. For example, it can be used in production environments and on large scale for big data applications. It also offers better performance than MySQL, which means that you get more bang for your buck. However, the main advantage of Oracle is its database management system. This makes the choice between these two databases very difficult. If you’re looking to choose one database, I’d recommend choosing Oracle. Which Database Should You Use? The first question you’ll probably ask yourself is, “Why should I use this database?” Well, if you’re using an open source application like Postgres, then it’s worth considering whether you want to run with Apache Cassandra as well. In fact, there are many other options out there. One option would be to go with MongoDB, but that’s not really my cup of tea. Another option might be to try Couchbase, since they offer some great features such as REST APIs. But again, I’m not sure how well those work out.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying. If your database has a lot of data, it will be more efficient for the programmer and less likely to crash if there isn't enough memory available in that area (or even worse). You can also use SQLite's built-in support which allows multiple databases with different versions of each other without having any issues at all! The best way to do so would probably not require much effort but I have seen people using both systems over time when they wanted something similar as well - especially since most users don´t want to spend their hard earned money running one system while another uses an older version like mysql.","The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you are using a database that has been updated for the last 5 years, it may be possible to update its data in some way (e-mailing) without having to worry about updating any of its databases at all!","The answer to this question depends on how you define the term ""mysql"". The most common definition of a database, and one that I've found useful in many situations over time, are databases with multiple tables. These can be defined as having more than two records (or even just three), but they also have different types of data structures such as indexes which may contain other information about each record's value rather then simply an index itself; for example if we want our table name like'my_table' it would look something similar except instead of being indexed by its own unique key there will be no way to find out what type of object has been created from those objects so any queries made using these methods should return nothing at all! In fact when querying your SQL Server Database Engine API calls might fail because some fields don't match their values correctly due not knowing where exactly them were stored before calling query().","The best way to get started with the database and its dependencies, especially for a beginner. It's not that easy because you need some basic knowledge of how SQL works (and what it does).","I'm not sure. I've been using the same database for a few years now and it's still pretty good, but there are some things that need to be improved (like how we can use more of our data in different ways). For example if you're running an SQL Server 2012 R2 environment with PostgreSQL installed on your machine then this should work fine too!"
24,Python,Lisp,"Let me be clear: I think Lisp is more powerful language than, say, Python or Java.
Compare this to languages such as Python, Ruby, and Java, which have a standard ways of handling networking and the web and you can see why developers might think that Lisp is somewhat lacking in this area.","This thing just feels like an Emacs that's based on Python instead of Lisp.
"" , this explains why Python code will always be easier to read than Lisp, without being a veteran in the language.

Common Lisp is a native-compiled language which provides even more dynamism than the popular interpreted languages like Perl, Python, Ruby and PHP.","It's a hard decision but I choose python. Its benefits seem to be more significant. If Python is better than Perl because it has simpler syntax, then LISP is better than all languages ever because the LISP syntax is the simplest.If you mean GOFAI, I consider the Python sources of AIMA much easier to understand than the lisp sources.Since Python does much more comprehensive type checking than other Lisp compilers, Python will detect type errors in many programs that have been debugged using other compilers. lisp has strong sides too. (And, I was thinking, Common Lisp implementations typically execute code much faster than Ruby and Python!)TXR Lisp programs are shorter and clearer than those written in some mainstream languages ""du jour"" like Python, Ruby, Clojure, Javascript or Racket.The Scala compiler catches a lot of ""stupid"" mistakes that the Lisp compiler does not (but the Lisp compiler catches some, much more than Python, Ruby, et.","I would prefer to use python because it is: syntax, simpler, languages, but lisp is: faster, compiler, easier","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If you want a language with a strong type system, then Lisp will be your best choice. However, if you just need something for writing simple programs, and don’t care about type safety, then Python might be better. The reason why Python has such an impressive type system is because it was designed by Guido van Rossum, who also wrote Python. He wanted a simple, powerful language, which would allow him to write code in his spare time. This meant he had to design everything from scratch, so there were no existing libraries of any kind. In order to make things easier, he decided to use symbols instead of types.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something more than just an implementation of some standard library, then Lisp may be your best bet. But if you’d like to write code in Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, etc. and have it run faster because it’s compiled with better optimizations, then I’d say go Python. In my opinion, there are two main reasons why people choose one language over another. The first reason has nothing to do with performance but everything to do with ease of use. For example, when writing code, most programmers will use their favorite editor (Visual Studio, Sublime Text, etc) which makes coding much easier. However, many developers prefer to work with other languages such as Ruby or JavaScript so they can focus on creating great code. This leads me to believe that these factors play a role in choosing between languages. Another factor is personal preference. Some people love working with large amounts of data while others find it hard to get started without good documentation.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a program and get it running in less than 10 minutes, then Lisp will be easier for you. But if you want something more complex, like an interactive shell, then Python may be better. In fact, there have been some studies done comparing Python with Ruby (which has also gained popularity as a scripting language). The results showed that Python was faster at executing code compared to Ruby. However, when we look into how these two languages compare against each other, they actually show quite different results. For example, here is the comparison of execution times between Ruby and Python: 
 
 As you can see, Ruby takes about twice longer to execute code. This means that Ruby programmers tend to use Ruby libraries instead of using their own code, which makes them spend much more time writing tests. On top of that, Ruby developers often prefer to work with other people rather than working alone.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you're looking for an easy way of writing code, then Lisp may be your best choice. But if you are more interested in how things work and why they work, then Python will probably suit you. In my opinion, it's not just about syntax. It's also about understanding the underlying concepts. For example, when we say ""map"", we're really saying something like this: 
 
 map :: (a -> b) -> b 
 
 The first line says that we have two functions (f and g) which take some input values and return another function (a). This means that each time we call map, we need to pass it the result of our previous call. We can do this by using the bind operator with its argument a. So now we've got a new function, f, taking three inputs, returning one value each. It takes these inputs as arguments and returns a value.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is simply a quick and dirty way of writing code that can be run in any environment, then Lisp will probably do just fine. But if you want something more powerful, like an IDE for Python, there are many other languages out there. The point is, though, that it doesn't really matter which language you choose. You should have some idea about how much time you'll spend working with it. And even then, it's not always clear whether you're going to use Python all day every day, or only when you need to. So pick one language, but don't make up your mind until you've tried both before making a decision. In my experience, most people who say they won't work without a computer end up using one. It's easy enough to get used to, so long as you know where everything is. My own experience has been very different. I've had computers at home since childhood, but never worked from them.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't programming, then there's no point in learning any other language at all (or even if it does).","There are many different ways to write a program. The most common way of writing programs, however, involves using the language's built-in functions and macros (which can be used in any programming environment).","I think it's a good question. I'm not sure what the best way to answer that would be, but if you're going to write something like this in your own language (or even just for yourself), then there are two things we should consider when writing code with python and lisp : 1) The syntax of each line will vary depending on how much information has been written into them; 2). If they have some kind function called ""python"" which takes an input file as its argument, so far all these lines can't get any more complicated than normal.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't programming, then there's no point in learning any other language at all! You'll just have a bunch of code that will be useless for the rest (and probably not even useful if it doesn'nt work). And as I said before, though we can get away with writing our own languages and using them without having learned anything else yet – which would make sense since most people don`t need much more than basic C/C++ knowledge anyway - they already know how to write their programs well enough so why bother doing something new when one could learn from scratch? The best way around these problems are two things : 1) We should use some kind ""code-base"" instead ; 2 ) It might help us understand each line differently but also give an idea about where everything goes wrong. This means getting rid 'em up quickly by making sure every single piece has been written correctly!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. I think that the best way to understand it would be by looking at what's been done in other languages, and how they've evolved over time (and not just because we're all learning new things). For example you might say ""Python has a lot more features than Clojure"", but if there are many different ways for people to learn programming then maybe one should focus on those two instead! And so far most programmers have found their own language which works well enough with them both as opposed only being used when needed; however some may find themselves using another program while still having an idea about where something can go wrong - especially given current trends towards writing code from scratch rather quickly compared against newer technologies like Ruby/C# etc..."

Martin Odersky: Scala makes almost all aspects of programming easier than Java.So I'd say we have the same opinion here Anyway, I'd still like to hear if Scala is really faster than Java for the average application which doesn't focus too much on special features of one language... .Maintainability e.g. Scala code is often much more concise than Java (with all that boilerplate) and fewer LOC often means fewer places to screw up and less maintenance in the longer term. However, java is not be ignored, because it is IDE support for Java is much better than Scala but like you say Scala (and tools) will improve.Java is often simpler from a tooling/debugging perspective than Scala.Scala isn't even a 'better Java', as you can't use Scala to write libraries for Java programmers to use.","Looks like scala is better, because: easier, faster, code. However, java is not be ignored, because it is: tool, simpler, programmers.","Scala has a lot of features that are not available in Java. For example, it supports functional programming, which means you can write code without side effects. This makes programming much more readable and easier to understand. It also allows for better error handling, since the compiler will catch errors before they occur. Another advantage of using Scala over Java is its type system. You don’t have to worry about how many types there are, because all objects are immutable by default. In Java, if an object changes, then so does your code. If you want to change something on one object, you’ll need to modify every other object. With Scala, this isn’t necessary. The only thing that’s changed with each new class is what name you’re going to give it. So instead of having two classes named Person and Person, we now have three classes: Person.Class, Person.Employee and Employee.Class. Each Class implements a single interface. There are no methods added to these classes, but rather just interfaces. It’s easy to see why people like this.","I think Scala has a lot of good features and it can be used for many different things. But the main reason why people use Scala over other languages like Java, Ruby etc is because it’s very easy to learn and use. It also works well with existing frameworks such as Spring. So if you want something that will work on your current framework, then go with Scala, but don’t expect anything too special from it. It’s not going to make things easier than they are already. If you’re looking for an alternative language that’s more powerful in some areas, try Haskell, which is much closer to what most developers actually need. You might even consider Clojure – although there have been quite a few complaints about its performance compared to Java. The truth is, we all know how hard programming is. We just need to find ways to get better at it, so that when we’re done we’ll feel confident enough to share our knowledge with others. That’s where learning new technologies comes in.","Scala has a lot of features that make it more appealing to developers and programmers. It also comes with some drawbacks as well. For example, the language does not have any built-in support for concurrency, which means you cannot use threads in your application. You can only create one thread per task. This makes it difficult if you are trying to build an application using multiple threads. Also, there is no way to define custom types like interfaces or interfaces. In other words, all classes must be defined by their interface type. The type system is very powerful but sometimes hard to use. Another disadvantage of Scala is its lack of generics.","Scala has a lot of features that are not available in Java. For example, the type system allows you to write code with very high level abstractions. This means it can be used for writing complex applications without having to learn any new programming language. It also makes your application easier to debug. The language supports functional programming, which helps reduce boilerplate code. Another advantage of using Scala over Java is its support for concurrency. You don’t have to worry about race conditions and deadlock when dealing with concurrent applications. In addition, there are many libraries out there, such as goroutines, that make working on distributed systems easier. However, if you’re looking at getting into Java, I would recommend learning Clojure. It’s an extremely powerful language, but it’s still relatively new. If you’ve never programmed before, start by reading this article from my colleague Andrew Tanenbaum. He explains how Clojure works under the hood. There are two main reasons why people choose Java: speed and scalability. Speed comes down to performance. Scalability comes down to scale.","Scala has a lot of features that are very useful for writing web applications. For example, it allows you to write asynchronous code and use the JVM as an event loop. It also supports functional programming in its type system. However, this feature comes at a price. The main reason why I chose Scala was because it’s easy to get started with it. You can start by reading the official documentation on their website. After that, you’ll be able to read more about how they work and what makes them unique. Another advantage of using Scala over other languages like Ruby or Python is that there aren’t any performance bottlenecks when dealing with large numbers of concurrent users. This means that your application will run faster than if you’re working with smaller numbers. Also, since most applications don’t need to do much processing while they’re running, scala’s concurrency model doesn’t require extra memory resources. In my opinion, Scala is one of the best language choices out there. It’s not just good for web applications, but it’s great for many different types of projects.","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If it's a language that has been around for years, then the best way to get started with an IDE like Eclipse (or any other editor) will be through JVM and/and some of its features are very similar in nature. But if you want to learn more about how your project works from scratch without having had experience building anything before using one yourself — I recommend reading my article How To Build Your Own Project With A Simple Editor.","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. If you're a programmer, then it's probably best for the first time that one of these languages be used in production and not as an alternative language (e-mail me if I'm wrong). But there are other ways out which can work well with both types - e.-mails from my colleague at Google will do just fine; emailing them about their new book ""JavaScript vs JavaScript"" won't help much either because they'll have no idea what type each has been using before writing any code! And even though we've all heard some great things like 'the most powerful programming environment ever written' by David Foster Wallace, none really matters when working within JVM environments such Async/AsyncTask support isn`t needed anymore so why bother trying something different now?! I think many people would agree here was never going anywhere but rather being able use asynchronous tasks without having to write anything else...","I've been using both for a while now, and I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better"" and how much of a difference it makes. The best way to define the term, however (and I'm not saying that's impossible), would be as follows; in general terms, there are two things which make up an object class when compared with other classes within its own scope - one being called java. This means all objects have their respective namespaces defined at runtime so they can use any name from anywhere else without having to change anything about them themselves! In fact, most people think these concepts should only apply if your code has been written using some kind OfClass<T>, but then again we're talking here for simplicity :) So let me explain why each namespace defines itself differently... In order ToString() will return String(1) insteadOfToArray().","The answer to this question depends on the language you are using. If your project uses a lot of different languages, it may be easier to use one that has more features and less boilerplate code than another with fewer dependencies (such as JVM). However if you have multiple projects in development which need similar functionality but don't share common core technologies then there will likely still exist some differences between them such an issue might arise when working together for example from other developers who want to work independently while also having access both ways so they can collaborate without being forced into dependency conflicts! This article aims at providing information about how these issues affect each others' workflow by showing examples where we've found problems related only to those two types of libraries/frameworks used within our own applications - namely C#, Ruby & Python."

They are always willing and eager to help you out when it comes to learning. The best part about them is, they don’t force anything on you. You can learn whatever language you want as long as it’s not too complicated. In fact, if you’re a beginner like me, then you’ll be able to pick up any programming language pretty easily. If you’re more advanced, however, then there will definitely be some things that you need to learn. For example, I’ve learned how to use SQL, but I’m still trying to figure out what all of these new features are. This isn’t because SQL was hard for me; rather, it just took time for me to get used to. As far as teaching goes, though, PHP really does make learning easier. It’s easy enough where even beginners could do it. However, this doesn’t mean that you should start off your journey by using PHP. There are plenty of other languages that are easier than PHP too.","The answer to this question depends on the type of application you are building. If your app will be used for a specific purpose, then it makes sense to use Ruby. However, if your goal is just to make some simple web pages and have them serve up content in response to user requests, PHP might be better. In fact, I would say that both languages can do their job well. But what about when you’re building an entire application? You may want to consider using one language over another. For example, let’s assume we need to build a website with a database backend. This could mean writing code in Ruby, but also in JavaScript. Or maybe it’s time consuming enough to write all our HTML in JavaScript as well, so we’ll stick with Ruby! Which Language Is Better To Build Your Website Into? When choosing which programming language to use, there are many factors at play. Some people prefer Python because they like its syntax more than others. Others choose Java because they’re familiar with it.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from your web application. If you’re looking for a simple and fast way of building an application, then PHP might be better than Ruby. But if you are more interested in creating something that will last longer, with higher performance and scalability, then Ruby may be better. The main difference between these two languages lies in their approach towards concurrency. In Ruby, each thread can only communicate with other threads by sending messages back and forth. This makes it very easy to create concurrent applications. However, when using Python, there is no such thing as a single process communicating directly with another process. Instead, Python uses multiple processes which share memory but don't communicate. When one process sends data to another, all its children receive it. All communication happens through shared memory. Each child has access to the same memory, so they cannot interfere with each other. So while it’s possible to have many processes, it’s much harder to build applications where every application communicates with others.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to write a web application and have it run in one of these two languages, then PHP will be more suitable. However, if you want to build an entire application, with all its dependencies, using Ruby, then PHP may be better suited. In fact, there are many cases where both languages would work well together. For example, you can use Ruby for building a simple database server without any dependencies at all. You could also use PHP as part of a larger application. The only thing you need to do is create a file called php.ini inside your project directory containing some configuration options.","I have been working on a project for the last 6 months and it has taken me 3 weeks to get this far. The code base was written in PHP but now that we are using Ruby there will be no more issues. This means that all of my work can go into production with ease. Is it worth it? It depends what you want out of your project. If you just need something simple then yes it’s definitely worth it. But if you plan on doing some serious development then probably not. There are many other options available such as Node.js which offers much better performance than Ruby. Conclusion 
 
 In conclusion, while Ruby may not offer everything that PHP does at the moment, it still provides an amazing amount of functionality and flexibility. You don’t necessarily need to use Ruby when writing web applications because most developers already know how to write their own code.","The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to get started with Rails, try the following tips from our guide How To Build A Simple Application Using Rails.","This question has been asked many times before, but I think it's time to answer this one. It really depends on the situation and how you want to use your code in a project (or even just for testing).","The answer to this question depends on your situation.

It is also important to notice that python has such benefits as Python is a much cleaner design than JavaScript.","I would prefer to use javascript because it is: faster, uglier. Yet, python should also be noticed for it is: cleaner.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you want from a programming language. If you’re looking for something more powerful, then Python might be better suited. However, if your goal is just getting started with programming, and are not interested in learning any new languages, then Java would probably do fine. In fact, it has been my experience that most people who learn languages like Ruby or PHP have no idea how much they miss having these other languages. For example, when I was first starting out as an iOS developer, I didn’t know anything about JavaScript. But once I got into it, I found myself using it all of the time. It made me feel so comfortable writing code without worrying too much about syntax. And now I’m still using it. So while it’s true that there aren’t many good alternatives right now, at least there’s one that’s available now. Which language should someone start with? The best way to find out which language will work well for you is by trying it out. You can always try different versions until you get used to them.","I think that Python has a lot of advantages over JavaScript. For example, it can be compiled to native code and run on the JVM. It also supports multiple languages at once, which makes it easier for developers who are not familiar with one language to learn another. And finally, it’s easy enough for beginners to pick up Python, so they don’t have to worry about learning any other programming language. But there are some disadvantages as well. The biggest problem in my opinion is that you can’t use Python libraries like jQuery without using an external library. This means that if you’re developing web applications from scratch, you’ll need to write your own custom library instead of relying on third-party libraries. Also, because all browsers support JavaScript today, most people will want to make their websites work well across different browsers. So when writing code, you’ll often end up having to deal with compatibility issues. Another disadvantage is that many programmers won’t even consider Python unless they’re already working with it. If you’ve never used it, chances are, you probably haven’t heard much about it.","I am not sure which one to choose. Python seems more powerful and flexible than JavaScript. But you can use both in the same project. If you want to learn both, then choose Python, but if you just need a simple web application that works with JSON, go for Javascript. You will be able to do much more. The best way of learning JS is by reading books on it. There are many good ones out there. Here are some recommendations: 
 
 Learn jQuery - This book has been around since 2008 and it still remains relevant. It covers all aspects of jQuery. It’s easy to read and very well written. Learn Backbone 2 - A great introduction to React. It teaches how to build complex applications using this framework. Learning Angular 2+ - Another excellent book. It explains everything about Angular. You’ll get an overview of what Angular does and why it’s so powerful. In my opinion, these two books cover most important topics you’ll ever need.","The answer to this question depends on your programming language. For example, if you are a beginner in Python, then Python and JS will be the best choices for you. If you have some experience with JavaScript, then it would probably make sense to go with JS. However, there are many people who prefer both languages because they can use them at the same time. In fact, I think that most of us don't know what we want until after we start coding. So when choosing between these two languages, choose one language first before deciding which one. Which Programming Language Is Right For You? There are several factors that influence how much time someone spends coding each day. Here are just a few examples: 
 
 Your level of experience. This could mean whether you started learning computer science as an undergraduate student or you’re already working professionally with computers. You should also consider your skill level. Do you need to learn new technologies every day? Or maybe it’s more like once per week? How often does your company needs to change its codebase?","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If you want a language which can be used for any kind of application and has an excellent standard library then Python will probably be better than JavaScript. But if your goal is just to write some simple web applications with minimal code changes then it might not matter where you choose as long as you have good performance characteristics. In my opinion both languages are great but they do differ in their strengths and weaknesses. For example, while JavaScript does offer many features like object oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming, Python offers more powerful features, such as generators, pattern matching, etc. The main advantage of using Python over Java is its ability to handle large amounts of data without having to worry about memory usage because all objects are immutable. However, there are also disadvantages compared to Java. One disadvantage is that most libraries require additional dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc.) whereas Java’s dependency management system makes development much easier.","I've been using the Java language for a while now, and I'm not sure if it's really worth my time. But there are some things that make this more useful than just writing code in C++ (like calling functions from within an object), but also making use of other languages like Haskell to write your own stuff!","I'm not sure what the best way to describe this question would be. I think it's more of a ""what if"" kind, but there are some things that you can do with your code and then use them in other ways as well (like writing tests). You could write something like so: var test = require('test'); //... } But here we're using an object which has no properties at all! It doesn't have any methods on its own; instead, our class contains only one method called get(). This means when calling set(), everything will work just fine for us except maybe getting rid from memory allocation by setting up another function call before returning true, because those functions return false!","I'm not sure. I've been using the language for a while now, and it's great to have some of my favorite features in there! But what if you want more control over your code without having any extra dependencies on other languages (like Ruby)?","The best way to learn about programming languages and how they work together in a single language, the C++ standard library. It's not just for beginners; it also helps you get started with writing code that works well on your own computer (or even if there are other ways of doing things). The book covers all aspects from basic concepts like arrays to functions which can be used as templates within any program but without having to write them yourself! This includes using template engines such AsyncRenderer, FetchingTemplateSets.","I'm not sure if you can say that. I've been using it for a while now, and have used the same code in many different languages (including Java). It's also very easy to use with NodeJS as well; just add your own variables into this file so they're always available when needed!"

Its advantages speak for itself But java is Yes Java is quite a bit faster than Ruby.Java developers are much, much, much more common and Java is a far more applicable skill than Ruby.However Java requires more manpower than Ruby for coding.","It's a hard decision but I choose ruby. Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: easier, ie, higher, though the arguments for java (faster, developer, manpower) are strong too.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to write a web application with Rails, then it makes sense to use Ruby. However, if you want to build an app for mobile devices, and have some kind of data access layer in there, then Java might be better. In fact, there are many people who prefer using both languages at the same time. The key thing here is: don't try to make one language better than another. You should choose the best tool for each task. Which programming language? There are two main reasons why we chose Python over Ruby: 
 
 It has been proven time and again that Python can provide more features than Ruby, which means less code needed by developers. This also allows us to create smaller applications. We wanted to develop our own applications instead of relying on third party libraries. For example, when developing a new app, we could easily reuse existing libraries like Django, Angular, etc.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to write a web application that can be used by many people at once, then Java will probably work better for you. But if you want something more like an app where only one person needs access and it works well with multiple devices, then Ruby might be better. In my experience, however, when using Ruby, there has been no significant difference in performance between Ruby 1.8.7 and 2.7.9. The main reason being that both versions of Ruby have very similar code bases. This means that most developers should not need any additional help from their IDE than they would get writing in Ruby. Another important factor here is how much time you spend working on each project. For example, if you develop a new feature every day, then you’ll likely use Ruby 1.9 as long as possible.","I think the answer depends on what you want to achieve. If you’re looking for a language that will be useful in your day-to-day work, then Java might be better than Ruby. But if you’re more interested in developing software and have some experience with other languages, then Ruby would probably be better. The main reason why I’m not recommending Ruby over Java is because of its lack of support for generics. This means that, even though it has an excellent standard library like Java, there are still many things which can only be done by using classes instead of interfaces.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to write a web application and have it run in an environment where there is no need for any kind of security, then Java will be fine. However, if you want to build something with security as its primary goal, then Ruby may be better. In fact, I would say that Ruby has become more popular than Java. This can probably be attributed to two reasons: first, because Ruby is easier to learn compared to Java, and, second, because many people who use Ruby do so primarily for developing applications rather than building websites. The second point is also true about Rails. It seems like most developers prefer Ruby, but they don't seem to care much whether their code runs under Linux or Windows. Which language should you use? There are several reasons why one might choose which programming language to use. One reason is that different languages offer advantages over others. For example, Python offers better support for data structures such as lists, trees, dictionaries, sets, etc.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your web application. If you’re building a simple website that doesn’t require much interaction with the outside world, then Java might be better for you. However, if you need more complex functionality and are willing to spend some time learning how it works, then Ruby will probably do just fine. In my opinion, it’s not really about which language has the best development environment, but rather whether one of them can help you get things done faster than another one. I think that’s why most people choose Java. It seems like there isn’t as many good alternatives out there. But when it comes down to it, there’s no doubt in my mind that JavaScript is still the fastest way to build an application these days. About the author

His new book, A Little Bit Over, was recently released.","I'm not sure what to say about this question. I think it's a good one, and that the answer depends on your point of view (and you should be able see why).","Ruby and JavaScript are two different languages. They both have their advantages, but they're not the same thing at all (and I'm sure you can see why). The difference between them has to do with how we use our language in a real world environment; it's very hard for us programmers who want something that looks like an actual programming experience on top of what actually works well when using one platform over another because there isn't any way around this problem!",I'm not sure.,"The answer to this question depends on which language you are using. For example, if your project uses Python and C++ (or any other programming languages), then it's best that the compiler supports both of them at once! If not for these two features in particular, there would be no reason why a single program could ever run without support from another library such as JVM. However with Scala, we can easily add more libraries into our codebase by adding additional functionality like caching/compilation time between calls - even though they're all done within one line... This makes writing simple programs much easier than having multiple threads running concurrently over different files :) The only problem I have was when working around some problems where my application had too many concurrent processes while waiting until an exception occurred during execution so needed extra memory usage instead of just calling runtime methods directly! So what do developers need?","This question has been asked many times before, and I've always thought it was a good idea to ask. In fact the answer seems pretty clear when you look at what's going on in your codebase right now (and not just because of how much work goes into making sure that every single line gets executed). But there are some things we can do about this problem if our goal isn't simply getting rid all those lines from memory but also keeping them readable for future use cases like writing tests!"

An alternative script, that uses awk instead of sed/grep and is much shorter (provided by user valentijn): .","I advise choosing awk. As ghostdog74 has mentioned here or in other forums, awk is often faster than alternatives, such as perl and sed -- at least consuming less CPU time, I don't recall about real time, system time, or other resources, memory, etc. .So you're not saying for example that an awk script is faster than a sed script, just that a single awk script is faster than a script which calls multiple tools e.g. both awk and sed.When you're already used to C-style syntaxes and write in a more decompressed style, AWK scripts are easier to read than sed IMO. sed has strong sides too. AWK is a very good tool, but I think I will never need it enough to take the time to learn it instead of hacking my solution in sed or python.awk doesn't have the capability to make in-place substitution like the newer versions of sed.If the awk script fails because the input file contains lines that are too long, it should (but only in this case) run my SED script and afterwards run the AWK script again.","Taking into account the benefits of awk (faster, time, script), it is better. On the other side, sed is newer, input, rest.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is to get a bunch of people who have never used Rails up and running with it, then the best way to do that would be by using an AWK application. But if you’re just looking for some basic knowledge about how to use rails in production, then I think it’s better to stick with Sent. For example, let’s say we want to create a simple blog application which will allow us to post content from our site to other sites. We can start off by creating a new file called blog.rb inside src/main/app/. This file, like all Ruby files, contains two parts: one part is named after its parent directory (the root directory), and another part is named after the URL where it was created. In my case, I’m going to name mine blog-post.html.","The answer to this question depends on the type of application you are trying to build. If your app will be used for a specific purpose, then using an ASK in production can help prevent errors and improve performance. However, if your app will only ever run once, then it may not make sense to use an ASK. This means that we recommend against using an ASK as part of our development process. Instead, consider building your own custom request routing system with some additional features. For example, instead of passing requests through a single controller, create multiple controllers which each handle different types of requests. You could also implement a separate controller for every kind of request, such as GET / POST. In addition, you should avoid creating any sort of database connection between controllers. Instead build up a simple web service layer over top of the HTTP API, so that all requests go directly from one page to another. Finally, don’t forget about caching. When developing applications that need more than just basic functionality, cache them by setting up caches at various points along the way.","The answer to this question depends on the type of application you are building. If your app will be used for a specific purpose, then it makes sense to use an ASK method that returns true if the user has given permission. Otherwise, using an AWS Lambda function might make more sense. For example, in our case, we want to send users a message when they have logged in. This would require us to return false and also log them out.","The answer to this question depends on your use case. If you are using a tool that has been around for some time, then the choice of which one will be better may not matter as much. However, if you’re just starting out with Rails, and want something more lightweight, than I would definitely recommend AWK! It allows us to focus our efforts on building up our own infrastructure, rather than having to worry about how we can integrate it into other systems. In my opinion, there isn’t much difference between Set-Cookie and AWK: both allow us to set cookies in an arbitrary location within the application without affecting any other parts of the application. We don’t have to worry about whether it’s possible to access these cookies. This means that we get to build complex applications where every single part of the system needs to work together seamlessly.","The answer to this question depends on the type of application you are building. If your app will be used for a specific purpose, then it makes sense to use ASK instead of SED. However, if your app has no defined purpose and only serves as an interface between different applications, then using ASK over SURE would make more sense. In that case, we can simply define our own custom query language in order to perform actions based on user input. For example, let’s say we want to retrieve all users who have visited a given page since its last update.","The answer to this question depends on the type of car you're driving. If a sed has an automatic transmission, it's likely that its performance will be more than adequate for your needs and not depend too much upon how fast they are moving around in traffic (and whether their brakes work). A standard sedan with manual transmissions can handle up-to 5 mph faster but only about 1/3 as quickly if there's no steering wheel assist available at all times when turning left from behind; even so though these cars have been known by many people who drive them like normal vehicles do, most drivers don't know what kind – especially those using supercharged engines!","The answer to this question depends on the type of car you're looking for. The more expensive, it's easier to find a good one and get your hands dirty with them!","The answer to this question depends on your level of experience with the game.

The only thing you can do in order to find out which one will work best on your computer is to try them out. If you’re not happy with any distribution, then it’s probably time to switch over to another operating system. In this article, I’ll be going through some of my favorite distros so far. Some people may already know about them, while others might not. All these distros, including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Mandriva, Slackware, Arch Linux, Debian, OpenWrt and others, offer something different. They also come pre-installed with useful applications.

Which operating systems have most popular games? There were many different types of games, but they all had one thing in common: They were played by millions of people. For example, World of Warcraft was extremely popular, while Farmville was also very popular. These two games alone account for over half of all PC game sales. Other popular titles include StarCraft 2, Diablo 3, Left 4 Dead, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, Dragon Age II, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Elder Scrolls Online.","The answer depends on what you are looking for.

 The answer depends on the type of your question. If you are asking about integer arithmetic, then it makes sense to use floating point numbers because they can be represented as a single number in binary form. However, if you want to know what happens when an integer, float, double, etc. gets converted into another number, then using integers will give you more information than floating point. For example, consider this question: 
 
 This question asks for two values (x and y) that have been multiplied together. How many times do we need to multiply them before we get the correct answer? Answer: We don't really care how many times, but rather whether there was any difference between them. In other words, multiplying 2 by 4 gives us 5 - 4. But dividing 8 by 10 gives us 11 - 10. So why does multiplication always produce 11? Because each time we divide 8, we add one to it. And since 9 + 7 = 10, adding one to 0 produces 11.","Links What is better: Integer or Floating-point? – joshMay 3 '12 at 18:57

 The answer depends on what you are trying to do. If you're looking for a fast way of doing something that requires floating point precision, then the integer version will be faster than the floating-point version. But if your goal is just to do some simple math and not worry about precision issues, then the float version should work fine. In this case, I would go with float64. For example, consider this: 
 
 int main() { 
 printf(""%d\n"", 1, 2); 
 } 
 
 This code takes two integers (0 and 1) as input and returns an integer. It does so because it needs to return 2 in order to get back 1. So when we use float, it's going to take twice as long to print out 2. That's why we need to convert our result into float. Now let's say we're working with numbers like pi. We want to find the square root of pi using floats.","The answer to this question depends on the type of data you are working with. For example, if your application uses a binary format, then integer precision will be more appropriate than floating point. However, in other cases, it may make sense to use floating-point precision. In fact, there are many situations where using both types can lead to better performance. This article explains why you should choose one over the other. Why do we need floating? When dealing with large numbers like integers, floats, and doubles, they require some extra work from our code. We have to convert them into an array of 32-bit values before storing them. If we store these values as 64-bit values, that means we must also allocate memory for each individual value. That requires us to create new objects every time we want to access those values. To avoid this, we often use pointers instead of pointers. A pointer points at something which has already been stored somewhere. It allows us to save space by not having to keep track of all the different ways to get around this.","The answer to this question depends on the type of data being processed. If you are processing a binary file, then integer operations will be faster than floating point operations. However, if your program needs to process large amounts of data, such as spreadsheets and databases, then it makes sense for both types of operation to be used. For example, in our example above, we would use floats because they have better performance per unit size compared with integers. But if we were dealing with larger files, where each file takes up more space than an entire database table, then integers might make sense. In fact, there are many situations when using either floating-point numbers or integers can yield significant speed improvements. How do I know which one to use? There are two ways that developers choose between these operations: 
 
 Float vs. Int - This choice has been made by most programmers since the early days of computing. It was common practice at the time to write programs in assembly language so that their output could easily be converted into machine code.","Links What is better: Integer or Floating-point? – AziyMay 1 '12 at 15:28 
 
 @AZiy I think the answer depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is just to get a few numbers into memory, then integer and floating point will be fine. But if you want to do some math that requires more than 4 numbers, then it might make sense to use an array of integers. The reason for this is because integers can hold up to 8 bits, so they have enough room in memory for all those extra bits. In general, though, it's better to stick with floats since they're much faster when you're dealing with large numbers. For example, consider this: 
 
 int i; // float 2 
 { return i++; } 
 
 This code takes about half as long as doing something like this. It also has no overhead - we only need one copy of the value instead of two. And even though there may not seem to be any overhead, there's actually quite a bit of it. First, each iteration needs two copies of the value.","The answer to this question depends on the type of data you want. In general, it's best if your program has a single integer value that can be used as an input for any number in its range (e., 1 through 9). If there are multiple integers and one floating point constant then all numbers will have their own values at some later time; however these may not always match up with each other so they must both contain exactly what we're interested here! For example let us say our code uses two decimal places instead - 2147483647. This would result into something like 3 digits but since only three bits were needed I could just use 0xFFFFFFF, which gives me 4 bytes per byte plus 8 more than my original output from above... So now when using binary notation such things should work fine too :) However remember though : The first bit does NOT represent anything except how many times those four characters appear together!","This question has been asked many times, and I've always thought it was a good one. The answer to this depends on what you mean by ""better"": It's not as simple for me personally; the problem with using integers in programming languages like Java (and Python) isn't that they're too complicated but rather because of their inherent complexity – there are so few ways around them which can be solved without sacrificing performance!","The answer to this question depends on the type of data you want. The most common example I've seen for a floating point number in Haskell, and one that's often used by many programmers (and especially those who use C++), are integers such as 1, 2, 3. In fact it can be quite easy to write an integer with any precision greater than 0xFFFFFFF0 if we know what our input value should be at compile time; but there aren't really good reasons not only why they shouldn'nt work well when using them like numbers do now because their values don`t have much information about how far away from zero each side has been before being converted into something else!","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better"". The most common way of saying it, from a mathematical perspective (and I'm not talking about the general case here), would be that integer arithmetic and floating point are equivalent. But there's no such thing as an exact definition for these two terms in mathematics; they're just different things with their own definitions which can differ greatly depending upon how one interprets them at first glance! So if we want something like 1/2 = 2 + 3 then our solution should look quite similar but more complex than those numbers above - so let's say 5 * 4 / 6. This means both integers will have equal values when compared against each other because all three types share exactly same properties over time since only some may change based solely on changes made during development while others might shift slightly due either side of any given problem being solved correctly before its ever released into public domain...",The answer to this question depends on the type of argument.

I only used OpenGL in the beginning, where I was told OpenGL was better, faster and easier all together than Direct3D.Also, [you probably already know this, but here goes], OpenGL 3D games/applications run much faster under WINE than Direct3D ones.so, the version of OpenGL supported by the proprietary driver is higher than that of the open source driver which is not shocking but what I don't understand is why a Direct3D 9 game is not working with OpenGL 2.1 support through wine.And although not particularly common, translation layers such as ToGL and even bigger full-on wrappers are often used to bring big budget multiplatform games to OpenGL platforms, as the PC ports of many games are still primarily coded against Direct3D and native OpenGL renders are sparse.

If your goal is to create a 3D game, then the choice of which graphics engine to use will be critical. However, if you want to make an interactive application, like a web browser, and have some basic functionality in it, there should not be any problem with using either OpenGL or Direct3D. Both can provide good performance for most common applications. For example, I used both OpenGL, because it was faster than Direct3D, but also had better support for WebGL (Web Graphics Library) and Flash Player. In addition, they were easier to port to other platforms. Which one do you prefer: OpenGL or Direct3d? There are two main reasons why we recommend choosing OpenGL over Direct3D. First, as mentioned above, it has many more features that allow us to achieve much higher performance. Second, although it does require less memory compared to DX11, it still requires quite a bit of CPU time when rendering large scenes.","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you are a professional graphics artist and want the best performance for rendering 3D graphics, then go with OpenGL. However, if you just need something that works well enough for basic 2D games, then DirectX will do. In fact, there are many games out now which use both of these technologies. For example, in my own game, I have used OpenGL since version 1.0, but recently switched over to DirectX. This was because I wanted better performance, more features, and higher quality textures than what came bundled with Windows XP. How do I know whether an application supports OpenGL or Direct3D? There are two ways to tell this. First, look at the name of the application. Many applications simply call themselves “games” without any reference to their actual purpose. Second, check the documentation provided by the vendor. Some vendors provide detailed information about how they support each technology as part of the documentation. Which one should I use? You can decide based upon several factors.","The answer to this question depends on the type of game you play. If you’re a hardcore gamer, then I would recommend using OpenGL. However, if your games are more casual and don’t require much graphics power, then Direct3D will be fine. In fact, it may even make sense for some games, since both technologies have their pros and cons. For example, in my opinion, it’s better to use an open source tool like Unreal Engine 4 than proprietary tools such as Crytek. This way you’ll get access to all the latest features without having to pay extra money every month. On the other hand, if you’re not that serious about gaming, then go with Direct3D. It has many advantages over OpenGL – but also comes at a cost. Which one should I use? There isn’t really any right answer. You can either choose between two different technologies. But there are definitely benefits to choosing the best one.","The answer to this question depends on the kind of game you are playing. If your goal is simply to play a game, then it makes sense that you should use OpenGL. However, if you want to do more than just that, and have some serious gaming chops, then Direct3D will be better. This article explains why. In order for games to run at their best, they need lots of pixels. To achieve this, developers usually make sure that all graphics processing units (GPUs) in the system can handle as many pixels as possible. For example, most modern GPUs support up to 4 GB of video memory, so even though there may not be enough memory available to display every single pixel from an image, the CPU has plenty of room to store it. As long as each GPU gets its own dedicated address space, everything works smoothly. But what about when you’re playing games? Do we really need 8 GBs of VRAM? Or 16 GBs? How much RAM does my computer need? Well, it’s actually quite simple.","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you are a professional graphics designer, then the choice between OpenGL and Direct3D will be easy. But if you’re just starting out with game development in general, then it makes sense to go for OpenGL. This article explains why we recommend using OpenGL over Direct3D. Why do I need it? You can use OpenGL because it’s open source. It has been around since version 1.0 of the OpenGL specification, so there isn’t much that needs changing. However, as an open-source project, it means that anyone who wants to contribute code to the project must also share their code. That means that any changes made by one person can’t easily be incorporated into another person’s work. In addition, most games don’t have many features that require more than two renderers, which means they won’t benefit from all the new features. So even though OpenGL is free, its cost may make it less attractive compared to other technologies. How does it work? To understand how OpenGL works, let’s start at the beginning.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a gamer, then the best way to learn about DirectX 11 and Vulkan would be through an article by Mike D'Antonio at The Verge (which I highly recommend). He's written some great articles for both games in his series ""How To Learn About Graphics"" which can also help with understanding how DX11 works as well as what it means when we talk more broadly than just graphics cards today. You'll find that he has done quite good work here too!",The best way to get started with this game would be by playing the demo.,"The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you're looking for a way of using DirectX, then the best option would be Unity's GLSL API and its support in C# (which I've been working with).","The answer to this question comes down entirely from the fact that there are many different ways of rendering a scene. The most common way for an object in Unity's Scene API (which you can read about here) involves using multiple layers, which means we need more than one layer per frame and so on – it also requires us to have several separate render operations at once! This makes sense because if your code has two parts with no other components then each part will be rendered separately by all three elements together; but when doing something like creating new objects inside another component such as UIKit/UIEditor I would prefer not having any additional compositing between these pieces since they're already shared across them…so why should anyone care what happens after every single piece gets created?!","The answer to this question can be found in the following article. The main difference between these two approaches, which are both based on a single API (the ""OpenGL"" approach), has been that they use an abstraction layer called GL_ARB and thus don't support all of their features at once; instead, it uses one specific set-in shader for each framebuffer used by them - namely DXGI's GLSL2 implementation. This means you will need more than just your own hardware graphics card if using DirectX 11/12 with OpenCL enabled! In fact, there may even be some limitations when working within such environments as multi-threaded applications like Unity where multiple threads might run simultaneously without any additional overhead from rendering code... So what does Vulkan have going for it?!"

Smith.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re talking about the quality of a car, then Toyota and Dodge are better than Chrysler. But if you’re comparing it with other automakers, it’s not so clear. In fact, in some ways, Ford has been even worse. It was first introduced as an affordable car for middle-class buyers, but now its sales have fallen off a cliff. And while Ford’s problems may be more severe than those faced by Ford, they aren’t necessarily unique. Many American carmakers also face similar problems. Which makes one wonder whether we should really care that much which brand name gets our next car. After all, we’re all just consumers who want cars that will get us from Point A to Point B. Why do we need any particular brands? To understand why Americans buy different brands of cars, let’s look at another question: How many people own two cars. When I say two, I’m referring only to families whose incomes top out around $70,000 per year.","The answer to that question depends on what you think of the two automakers. For Chrysler, it would be a no-brainer. If you're looking for an American car company with global reach, Toyota has been around since before World War II and remains one of the most successful auto companies in history. And if you're looking for a Japanese carmaker, Nissan Motor Co. may not have quite as much history but still offers some great cars -- including its best-selling Infiniti brand. But for Toyota, it's hard to imagine how they could ever compete against their longtime rival. In fact, when asked about whether he thought his company's rivals were better than his, Toyoda said no. ""I don't know who else can beat us at this point,"" he said. ""We are very competitive.""

And while there are some people who would prefer an all-new car, they should probably stick with their current car. In fact, according to data from Kelley Blue Book, only about half (47 percent) of buyers say they’re willing to buy a car that’s more than 10 years old. That’s compared to just under two-thirds (62 percent), who said they’d rather pay less money now so they’ll get better value later. It’s also worth noting that many consumers don’t want to spend big bucks upfront because they’ve got other things going on.

The most common way of finding out which car has the best performance and reliability rating in a given category, however, can be found by comparing it with other cars that are similar (or comparable) but have different engine types/components – like BMWs etc., Mercedes-Benz's V8 engines tend towards more efficient powertrain designs while Audi uses less powerful turbocharged versions such as those from Porsche; Honda also makes its own hybrid vehicles using smaller displacement than VW does today because they use lower compression ratios so there isn't any need anymore when compared against older models' larger 'diesel'.","The answer to that question comes down to the fact that both companies are competing for market share in a rapidly changing industry. Both have been around since at least 1970, and each has grown from being an auto manufacturer into one of the most successful automakers ever built by American consumers (and perhaps even more so than Ford). The two brands also compete with other manufacturers such as General Motors Inc., which was founded on its own brand name but now operates independently; Fiat-Chrysler Co.; GMC Automobiles Ltd.'s parent company Pontiac Motor Corp.—which makes cars like those produced under their original names—but not all vehicles made after 1969 were manufactured before then.

If you're looking for an affordable, reliable and fun vehicle with great performance on your hands, then this one might be right up there! It's got all of these things in common – it has good handling characteristics (like being able drive yourself around), excellent fuel economy and low emissions levels which are both very important when choosing between two different vehicles at once. The only thing missing from most people buying cars like those made by Honda will always be their choice as they have no other options available besides what we call ""high-performance"" models such Asperger syndrome/hyperactivity disorder where driving becomes difficult due not having enough energy left over after hours spent working out how much time each person should spend doing something else than sitting still while eating lunch etc.","The answer to that question was a simple one. The two companies have been in business for more than 50 years, and they've both had great success with the same products — but there's no doubt about it now as automakers are moving into new markets like China (and India) where their vehicles can compete against each other on price points of $100-200 depending upon who you ask them to buy from. And while some may argue this could be good news if we're talking about cars priced at over 100k miles per gallon today, many consumers will still want something less expensive when buying an SUV because its performance isn't going up by much compared either way; even though these models offer very similar features such things don' t matter anymore due largely towards lower fuel economy ratings which means buyers won 't care'. So what do I think would happen once all those changes were made – especially given how well Honda has done so far under current management?","The answer, of course. Both are big business and have been for decades now. But the two companies that dominate American auto production today — Ford Motor Co., which has more than 1 million employees in its plants across North America; General Motors Corp.; GMC Automotive Inc.'s Detroit plant (which produces about 20 percent less cars per year); Fiat-Chrysler's Pontiac factory near Toledo -- both produce a lot fewer vehicles each day because they're built on top of one another rather then from scratch with some sort ""competition"" system to keep costs down while also keeping them competitive against other automakers' products at home. The result is lower prices by making it easier—and cheaper–for consumers to buy their own car online insteadof buying an expensive vehicle through dealerships like Craigslist."

This means they should do well even when driving around town as long as there isn’t too many other cars. In addition, while most people would say that the engine sounds louder than Audi’s, it’s not really true. It actually has less noise but still gets pretty loud when you’re cruising down the highway. When I’m driving, I don’t notice any difference. Both vehicles also get very hot during acceleration so you’ll need some sort of seat cover or sunshade to keep yourself cool. Also, although they’re both made by Japanese automakers, they aren’t exactly comparable in terms of quality.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car with the most power, then go with Toyota. But if you’d rather have an SUV that’s more comfortable and has better handling, then Honda might be right up your alley. Both companies are known for their excellent quality of engineering, but in terms of fuel economy, they both fall short. That’s why we decided to compare them head-to-head. We wanted to find out which one was best suited for our needs. Our test vehicle was a 2015 CR-V EX-L Touring equipped with either a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine rated at 240 horsepower (250 kilowatts) or a 3.5-liter V6 engine. It comes standard with heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, rear parking sensors, satellite radio, Bluetooth, keyless entry, power windows, cruise control and, as standard, blind-spot monitoring. All this equipment costs about $4,500 extra.","The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you want a car with the best fuel economy, then Honda and Toyota are both good choices. But if you’re looking for something more efficient than either Toyota, it’s Toyota. And that’s what makes this story so interesting. In fact, in terms of overall efficiency, it doesn’t matter which brand wins out — they all have their place. However, there are some things about each automaker that make them stand out. For example, while most people think of gas mileage as being important, there’s another factor at play here – power. A lot of cars today use electric motors because they’re cheaper and easier to make. That means less need be spent making them. So when we talk about “efficiency,” we’re really talking about power efficiency. Power efficiency can mean different things. It could also refer to how much energy an engine uses per gallon of fuel. That’s why many manufacturers claim higher figures for fuel economy ratings rather than actual miles driven.","The answer to this question depends on which brand you're talking about. The two brands are often referred as ""Honda"" and the other being ""Toyota."" While both of these companies have a reputation for producing high-end cars, they also produce some very good ones that can be used in many different ways depending upon your needs (e., gas mileage).","I'm not sure. I think that's a good question, but it depends on what you're talking about and how much of your time they spend with the car in front of them (and when). If there are no other options for this type vehicle then maybe we should just go ahead and buy one instead!","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had strong relationships with the public, and they've both made it clear that their products are not for everyone. But in recent years there's also become more interest from consumers who want something different than what we're seeing on our cars today. And while some of these new entrants may be good choices at first glance, many people will find them difficult to get used by themselves because most automakers don't offer any incentives beyond those offered through traditional car sales channels like auto loans (which can cost up $100 million).","The answer, of course. The two companies have been in the same boat for years now and are both looking to expand their market share by making more cars available at a lower price point than they can afford today. But there's no doubt that this will be an uphill battle as consumers demand higher-end models with less power consumption (and thus fewer emissions). And while some automakers may want buyers who don't like what you're doing on your car — which could mean paying $100 cheaper per year if it were built using gasoline instead—Toyota has made clear its desire not only toward smaller vehicles but also towards larger ones too; so far last month we've seen three new compact SUVs hit sales numbers below 50k miles – all from Japanese brands such Asha & Co., Ford Motor Company and Nissan Motors Japan Ltd. In fact, just one other brand was able get off zero mileage after five months' worth production time alone!","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" The two companies have long had similar problems with the powertrain, and both are now in their third year of existence. But it's not just about how they're doing things; there was some debate over whether either would be able (or willing) for them at all if given an opportunity like that—and even then neither company seemed particularly interested in making sure its competitors were as good off-roaders themselves when compared against other manufacturers' offerings on offer today. [1] It seems likely though that while these three automakers will continue to compete well into 2017 without any significant changes whatsoever from what we've seen so far,[2][3], those who want more competition may find something else entirely different here than before after years spent trying out competing products based solely around one brand alone[4]."

But they don't make lenses for this camera. So what can you do? You need to buy an adapter from one of these companies like Tamron or Sigma which will cost more than $100. And then you still don’t get any better quality at all. This is why I am looking into buying another camera in order to take pictures on my vacation. Do you think there should be some kind of standard for cameras so we could compare them? Or would you prefer if manufacturers just made different models based on your needs? Yes, but that’s not going to happen. There isn’t enough money in it. If someone wants to sell me something new, he has to pay me. That’s how things work. We can’t change that. That doesn’t mean people shouldn’t try new things. It means we as photographers have to accept our limitations.","I think the best answer to this question would be that both are excellent cameras and they have their own strengths. The main difference between them lies in how well you can use them. If you’re looking for a camera with an amazing high ISO performance then Nikon has it covered. But if you want something more compact than your DSLR but still capable of producing great images, then Leica’s M9 might just do it. And while it’s not as good at low light shooting as its bigger brother, the D850 does offer some very nice features like live view and HDR modes. It’s also much smaller and lighter than either of those cameras. So which one should you buy? Read on to find out. Why buy a digital SLR? There are many reasons why people choose to purchase a digital SLR instead of buying a film camera. One reason being that they’re easier to carry around compared to film. Another big advantage over film is that when taking pictures indoors there’s no need to worry about getting dust into the sensor.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a camera that will give you great pictures and be able to produce them quickly then go with Leica. However, if you need something more than that, like being able to shoot in low light situations for example, Nikon might be your best bet. The Df format of these cameras means they can do that. But again, it comes down to personal preference. Which Camera Should You Buy? There are many different types of digital cameras, but there are two main categories which everyone should consider: compact point & shoots and DSLRs. These cameras have similar features such as image stabilization, high ISO performance, etc. They also share some key features, including interchangeable lenses, viewfinders, video recording, etc., so it’s important to choose one that’s right for you. Here are my top 5 picks from each category.","I have been using a Nikon D800 for the past year and am very happy with it. The camera has many features that are not available on other cameras in its price range. However, there are some things about it which make me feel uncomfortable when compared to my old camera. Here they are: 
 
 1. It does not support RAW files as well as most of the competition. This means you cannot use any software like Lightroom 3 to convert your images into DNG files. You can only do this by shooting raw files, then converting them back to DNG. If you want to shoot JPEGs instead, you’ll need to buy an expensive program called Raw Converter. In addition, if you’re going to be doing much processing (like cropping) before exporting your images, you will probably end up spending more money than necessary because Adobe Photoshop CS6 doesn’t work properly with the new cameras. 2. There isn’t enough control over exposure compensation (shutter speed, ISO etc.)","I have been a Nikon user for many years and am now considering the purchase of an Olympus E-M1. The main reason being that it has much better image quality than my D7000. However, there are some things about this camera which make me think twice before buying it. First off, the lens selection on the OM-D line up seems to be very limited. There are only two lenses available at present – the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, and the 50mm f/1.4. This makes purchasing any other lens seem like a waste of money. If you want more zoom range, then you’ll need either the 35mm f/1.8 or 45mm f/2.8. Both these options come with their own set of drawbacks, but they do offer advantages over the kit lens. For example, if you’re going to shoot in low light, it’s nice having both options. But as far as I’m concerned, neither option offers enough range for most situations.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. The best way to find out about the two cameras that have been around since they were introduced in 1959, and which one has become a standard of photography today, would be by comparing them with other camera models from different eras (e-mail me at kim@michiganphotography.com).","The answer to this question depends on which lens you choose. The best choice for your needs can be found in the following categories, but there are a few that will help with any of these questions and others as well (see below).","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. The two most popular lenses are the Canon and Sony, but there's a difference between them when it comes down for me personally. I prefer my camera with an EF-S 18mm f/2 lens over one that has both optical elements in its body (the front element). This means you can get more out of each type by using different focal lengths as well - if they're not interchangeable then what works best will depend upon how much focus distance required from which aperture mirror(s) those mirrors use at any given time. In general though, focusing distances should be about 1 meter apart so long as their respective optics aren't too far away!","The answer to this question depends on the type of camera you're using. If it's a DSLR, then there are some lenses that offer more versatility and can be used with less power than other cameras in your budget (such as Canon).","The answer to this question depends on the lens you choose. If your camera has a built-in sensor, then it's probably best for shooting in low light conditions (elevation of 50 meters). But if not with an aperture that can be adjusted manually by hand and/or using manual focus controls such as AF+S2+, there are plenty more options available than just focusing at infinity point where possible! The only thing I would say about these lenses being good enough when compared against other cameras like Sony A7R II, Canon EF 24mm f1.4L IS USM Lens which have improved ISO sensitivity over their predecessors but still suffer from poor image quality due mainly TOC exposure compensation issues. This article will cover all those problems so we'll get into them later..."

On the other side, nissan is deeper, bigger, horsepower.","I have a Honda Civic and it has been my daily driver for the past 3 years. It was an excellent car but not as good in handling as other cars like Toyota Corolla, BMW 5 Series, Audi A4, etc. But now with new generation of Civic, they are getting better at handling. The only thing that bothers me about this car is its lack of power compared to others. This is because there is no turbo engine on it. So when you accelerate from 0 – 60 kph, your engine does not get enough boost to help out the car. Also if you want more power, then go ahead and buy a turbocharger which will cost around $2000. If you do that, then you can easily afford to spend another $1000 on a supercharger. You might also consider buying some kind of performance exhaust system such as Flowmaster muffler. These things add up over time so make sure you keep them updated. Also, check your oil level. Your engine should be running smoothly without any problems. Check yours regularly too.","The answer to that question depends on what you consider a “better” car. In the case of Nissan, it seems like they have more options than Honda, but I don’t think Honda has as many options. If you’re looking for something with better fuel economy, I’d go with either one of them. But if you’re just looking for a good car at an affordable price, then it’s hard not to choose either. Which Car Is Better For You? There are two main factors in choosing between these cars: price and mileage. Both cars offer great value compared to their competitors. However, there are other things to consider, such as: 
 
 Reliability – How long will your car last? Are you willing to pay extra money for it? Do you want reliability over performance? Comfort – Does this car make driving easier or harder? Will it be comfortable enough so you’ll enjoy using it, even when driving? Aesthetics – Can you tell which car belongs to you?","I have been a fan of the Honda Civic since it first came out in 1993. It was my first car and still remains one of my favorites. The original model had an engine that could easily be considered underpowered for its time, but over time this has become more than just a minor annoyance. In fact, it’s now regarded as one of the best cars ever made. It’s also very affordable. This makes it great if you are looking to buy your first car. However, there were some problems with the Civic. For one, the fuel economy wasn’t great. Even though the Civic was rated at 25 mpg, many people found themselves getting only about 20 miles per gallon on their commute. Also, the gas tank didn’t hold enough gas. You would often find yourself filling up every few days because you couldn’t get through all 50 miles. Finally, the interior design left something to be desired. While not bad, it lacked any kind of luxury feel. When the new generation of Hondas debuted in 1998, things began to change.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car that’s fun and easy to drive, then the Honda Civic Type R will be right up your alley. But if you’d rather have an SUV with more power than style, you’ll probably prefer something like the Toyota Highlander Hybrid. Both are great cars in their own right, but they both share one thing in common: They can go fast enough to make driving them feel like a blast. Advertisement 
 
 That’s why we think it’s important to look at how these two vehicles stack up. And while it may seem silly to compare the two, we’re not going to. These aren’t just any cars. They’re some of the most powerful cars ever made, so comparing them isn’t really fair. So let’s start by taking a closer look. First things first, the Civic’s engine is rated at 302 horsepower (305 kW) and 258 lb-ft (416 Nm) of torque. That puts its top speed around 155 mph (247 km/h).","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a car with the best fuel economy and most comfort, then Honda will do just fine. But if you want something more sporty than that, then look at Nissan. They have been making cars for over 100 years now, so they know how to make great cars. And their new NSX sports sedan has got some serious power behind it. It can go from 0 - 60 in less than 3 seconds. That makes it one of the fastest accelerating vehicles out there. However, there are plenty of other options as well. You could choose between BMW, Mercedes, Audi and even Porsche, depending on your budget. In fact, these three brands all offer excellent value compared to their rivals. So which brand would be better suited for you? Let us help you decide. BMW M5 – This German luxury automaker offers an impressive range of models including the M5, M6 Gran Coupe, M4 Coupe and X5 Sportback.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" The two companies have long held the title of best-selling car brands, but they've also become increasingly competitive with each other. In fact, in 2013 alone, Toyota and Ford were ranked No 1s by CarWeek's Top 100 for their performance cars (and top five overall).","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The two companies have had very similar success stories, and both are now in the top 10 for most miles driven on their vehicles (and even more so when you consider how many people drive them). But what about those who don't own an electric car yet — like me? Or maybe they're just not ready with one right away because of some other reason besides cost-cutting issues such as lacklustre sales numbers from automakers already struggling to meet demand at home?","The answer to this question depends on the car you're driving. The best way to determine which one suits your needs and preferences, however, can be done by looking at a list of all available options for each model in its class (see below).","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. If your goal in life isn't getting a car, then the best option would be either an electric vehicle (EV) that's more affordable and has less maintenance costs than most other EVs available today — like Tesla Motors' Model S sedan with its battery pack capacity of just 1 kWh per charge; if it can handle all those miles without any problems at night when driving around town while still being able drive comfortably through traffic—or one where there are no distractions from using our smartphones so we don´t have trouble sleeping during long hours as well!","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for.

And finally, if you simply don’t care about all of those things, there isn’t much difference between these two models. They both have great battery life, fast processors, solid keyboards, and amazing displays. Which one should I buy? There really aren’t any hard choices here. You could buy either one, as long as you’re willing to sacrifice some performance in exchange for better build quality.

If you’re using Firefox instead, you’ll be happy with either one. And even though I’m not an expert in web design, it’s easy enough to make sure that all pages look great without any extra effort. So why would anyone want to use another browser besides Chrome? In my opinion, there are two main reasons people choose other browsers over Chrome. First, they don’t like how slow Chrome is. Second, they’re afraid they’ll lose control of their data when switching from Chrome to Firefox. That’s because most users will never switch back to Chrome after switching.

In fact, it’s probably better than any alternative out there. So what are some alternatives to Android? Let’s start with iOS. It’s still very much an open platform, but many developers have already begun porting their games over to iOS, so there’s no reason why Android can’t do the same. This means there will be plenty of great titles available when iOS finally gets around to supporting them. For those who don’t care about games, however, another option would be Windows Phone. Microsoft may never get as popular as Apple. However, they offer a lot more features than Android, including Cortana integration, which makes using them easier than ever before.","I am not a fan of either company but they are both very good at what they do. The only difference between them and Microsoft is that Google has more money to throw around. They have the best engineers in the world working for them. Their products work better than any other company. And their market share is growing every year. So why would you choose one over the other? If you want something done right then go with Google. You will get it done. But if you just want things done, then go with Apple. There are many reasons people prefer Apple, including the fact that they make great products. However, there are also some disadvantages as well. For example, Apple’s product line seems to be getting smaller year by year, which means that new features may take longer to come out. Also, because of this, users might feel like they don’t know where everything is. This can lead to frustration when trying to find things. Another disadvantage is that Apple tends to charge higher prices on certain products, such as iPods.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a fan of the Google Chrome browser, then it would be hard not to like Apple’s browser. However, if you’re looking for something that will give you more control over what sites and applications can access your data, then Safari might just be right up your alley. In fact, Safari’s new features may actually make browsing with Firefox even better. For example, when using Firefox, you’ll see an option in Settings called “Privacy & Privacy.” This allows users to choose whether they want their data sent back to Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter etc. Or not. It also lets them set how much information about themselves they’ll share with these sites. And finally, there is now a feature called “Data Saving,” which automatically saves web pages as soon as they’re opened. You don’t have to do anything except click through each page one by one. As far as I know, no other browser has done this.","The answer to this question depends on the type of device you are using and what kind of data it collects. If your phone uses a cellular connection, then Google will be able to track where you go with its GPS. But if you’re not connected to any network, you’ll have no way of knowing how much information it’s collecting about you. And since Android phones don’t use GPS at all, they won’t know either. In other words, while both companies collect data, Apple’s tracking system may actually do more than just tell you when you’ve been in certain places. It could also help identify people who might want to harm you, like stalkers. Or maybe even terrorists. This isn’t exactly new. Back in 2013, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University found that mobile carriers were secretly recording their customers’ location data. They didn’t say anything publicly until last year, but they’ve already started sharing some details publicly.","The answer to this question depends on the type of device you're using. If your phone has a screen that's bigger than 4 inches, it will be able see more pixels in front and center (and therefore less light) while still being visible from far away—the same as if they were sitting next one at night with their phones outstretched across an open window for hours straight without any distractions whatsoever! But what about when there are no screens around so people can't get close enough by looking up into them like we do now?! That would make sense because our eyes have been trained not only against those things but also toward other objects too…like glass walls which look exactly alike except where some kind ""glass"" was used instead...which means something very different between us all!!","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes."" In fact, the two companies have become synonymous with each other. The iPhone and iPad are both great phones for people who love their gadgets but don't want to spend money on them anymore. But there's one thing they don't share in common — namely an obsession over how much you should pay when it comes time to buy something new from your friends (and family). And while many of us might be tempted by these devices as our way out-of–the box gadget purchases, we're also often left wondering what exactly makes those things so special compared against others like Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge smartphones which cost $399 at launch ($349 now) versus just about any smartphone ever made before – even if only because some may find this comparison too offensive! So why does everyone think Android isn' all bad news after everything else goes wrong here?!","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The iPhone 6S and the iPad Pro are both rumored for release in early 2018, but it's not clear if they will be released as well (or even before).","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have never really had the same success in terms of user experience, and they've always struggled with how users interact. But that's not necessarily because their products are bad; it just means there aren't many good alternatives for them right now. And while some people might be tempted by an iPhone 6 Plus as being more than adequate (and maybe even superior), others may find themselves looking at something else entirely when trying out new features like Siri on iOS 8 — which will likely make things much easier if you're using one instead—or Android Wear 2+.","The answer to this question has always been the latter. In fact, it's a pretty good one at that—Apple and Google have both made great strides in their respective fields over the last few years; they're still very much competitors on every level of hardware development (and even if you don't agree with them all about what constitutes ""better""), but there are some things we can learn from each other as well. For example…the iPhone 5S isn't going anywhere anytime soon because its battery life will be so limited by how many hours your phone spends charging before needing an upgrade for use purposes like voice calls/text messages etc., which means more time spent using apps when needed instead than waiting until after-hours work days where most people spend less money doing stuff such Asperger syndrome tasks while trying not only get rid outages faster without having too long waits between callings though —but also make sure users aren`T getting sicker due either way!"

But i should tell you that toyota is: ave, higher.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is a car that will last for years, then the choice between Honda and Toyota may be obvious. But if you want something more practical, with good fuel economy and low emissions, then it might make sense to go with Honda. This is because they have been making cars since before World War II, so their reputation as reliable vehicles has helped them gain market share. They also offer excellent customer service, which makes buying one of these cars easy. And while there are many other brands out there, none can match the reliability of Hondas. Choosing Between Two Models 
 
 There are two models available in the U.S. market, both made by Japanese automakers. Both come standard with an automatic transmission. However, some people prefer manual transmission cars, especially those who drive long distances. Some buyers even choose to buy only one model from each manufacturer. In fact, most Americans would probably opt for either model. A few years ago, I bought my first car, a 2004 Nissan Maxima.","The answer to this question depends on the type of vehicle you drive. If you’re a daily driver, then Toyota and Honda are both great choices. But if you’re looking for something that will be used only occasionally, then Honda may be your best bet. Both companies offer excellent warranties as well. Which car would make an ideal first car? You can get a good idea by asking yourself which one you’d like to buy first. Then you’ll know whether it’s worth buying two cars in order to have them all at once. For example, let’s say you want to start with a new car, but don’t yet own any other cars. Would it be better to go ahead and purchase another brand new, more expensive model right away so you won’t miss out on anything later on? Or do you think about what kind of car you already have, and decide how much money you need to spend now before investing more? That’s why we recommend starting off with a cheaper model. You’ll save money down the road when you upgrade later.","I think it depends on the situation. If you are a car enthusiast and want to have fun with your car, then go for Honda. But if you just need something that will get you from point A to B without any hassle, then Toyota might be better choice. The reason why people like Toyota cars so much is because they make great cars. They also know how to build them. So even though there may not be many of them in the US, their quality has been very good over the years. And now we can see this trend changing as well. It seems like every year new models come out which are more powerful than before. This means that manufacturers are trying harder to improve performance while keeping prices low. There are some brands who do this, but most don’t care about price at all. In fact, they tend to increase production numbers rather than decrease it. That makes sense since they would lose money by doing so. However, when it comes down to it, these companies still sell lots of cars, so it’s hard to say whether they actually care.","I am not sure which one to choose. The reason why I have decided on Toyota for my next car purchase is because of the following reasons: 
 
 1) It has a very good reputation in Japan and it does not seem that they are going to change that. They have been around since the early 1900’s so you know there will be no problems with their quality control. 2) Their cars are built here in America by American workers. This means we can expect them to last longer than other cars. 3) They offer great discounts when buying new vehicles. 4) If something goes wrong with your car, they will fix it. No hassle at all. 5) There are many different models available from them. You don’t need to worry about getting stuck with an older model. 6) Most importantly, they make excellent customer service as well. When you buy a vehicle from them, you get a free oil change. That alone makes me want to go back every time.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car that’s fun and easy to drive, then the Civic Si might be just right for you. But if you’d rather have something more sporty with better handling than an average sedan, you’ll probably prefer either the Toyota Camry Hybrid, which has been around since 2008, or the BMW 3 Series Coupe, which was introduced in 2009. Both of those cars are great cars, but they don’t offer anything particularly unique about them. They both come standard with front-wheel drive and, like all modern sedans, can go as fast as 155 mph. They’re also much cheaper than their Japanese counterparts, at least when it comes to new cars. Advertisement 
 
 In fact, it’s not even clear whether any automaker offers a comparable product line today. There are, however, plenty of models available today that, while they’re less expensive than some other models, still cost significantly more. For example, there are three different versions of the Chevrolet Cruze, each one costing between $32,000 and $40,000.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The Japanese automaker, which was founded in 1986 and now owns the world's largest auto manufacturing plant at Suzuka (the site of its first ever test drive), announced last year that it would build an all-new hybrid car with 3D printing technology for use on any new cars sold by 2020 — something only one manufacturer could do before then.","The answer to this question has been a resounding yes. The two companies are both very different in their approach and philosophy, but they have the same basic goal of making sure that everyone gets what it takes for them to succeed — not just those who make money off cars like Mercedes-Benz's F1 team do so well at doing things differently than others (like BMW).","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The best-selling car in the world, for example. It's a great sports sedan with lots of power and plenty of torque (and it has an engine that produces about 4 hp).","I'm not sure. I've been to both, and it's a little bit of an odd choice for me because they're two very different brands that have similar things in common (and the same thing). The difference between them being more like BMWs than Mercedes-Benz was pretty obvious when we first started talking about these cars back then; you could tell by their looks how much less expensive each car had become over time as well – but now there are so many other options out on sale with all those new models coming along which means even if one were really good at what he does today…it would be hard to justify buying another brand from him just yet!","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The best-selling cars are the ones that have been around for a while. And they're all pretty good, too. But there's one car in particular where I think it would be more appropriate if we could say something about its performance and reliability — which has always seemed like an obvious choice over other options (like Porsche). It was built with high quality components from both manufacturers; as such, these were not only very reliable but also extremely well engineered so far into their life cycle."

For me, it was an easy decision. The MSI GTX 1080 Ti GAMING X 8G Gaming Video Card has been on my wish list since its launch in late 2016. It had all of the features and performance I wanted at a price point that made me feel comfortable with it. This card also comes with NVIDIA’s latest generation Pascal architecture. That means it’s going to run games like Star Wars Battlefront II maxed out without any hiccups. It’s not just about performance, but also looks great too. If you want something that’s visually appealing, then you’ll love the look of the card.

 Your order should arrive within 4 business days. Business days are Monday through Friday.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan, it's probably more likely that the graphics card will be based off AMD chipsets than Intel ones (or even some other chip). But if there are multiple cards with different specifications and performance characteristics then they could all have similar specs in common – which would make sense given their unique architecture/performance differences between them. This may explain why many people think NVIDIA has less power for gaming when compared against its competitors like Asus' Zenbook UX305P vs Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge versus Apple iPhone 6 Plus / iPad Air 2. The same goes also for ASUS's Z97i, but not so much because both companies use very low-power processors instead! In fact I'm sure most consumers who buy these laptops tend towards using an older version rather as well since only one processor can do everything at once while others need two cores each… So what does ""better"" mean here?","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan, then it's probably best that the graphics card be equipped with an Intel Core i7 processor and not AMD Radeon HD 7970 (or even some other high-end GPU). The difference between these two cards might make them more competitive in terms for performance but also because they are both based on different parts of their architecture which means there will always have been competition from each manufacturer at various points along its lifespan as well!","The answer to this question depends on which you ask. If the two are not compatible, then there's no reason for them to be in your system and it will only work if they're both running at a different time of day (or night). But when one runs their own graphics card with an Intel Core i7 processor that has been overclocked up by 1GHz overclockers like AMD Ryzen 7 1800X/1800 series processors – even though those chips have had some performance improvements since last year - we can't say anything about what happens after each run because our tests were done using multiple GPUs from various manufacturers such as ASUS ROG Strix X370 Gaming Series / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M SLI cards. The results show very similar things happening between these three models so I'm going to assume all four should still support DirectX 11 but without any further changes due back-to--the old way!","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. If your goal isn't just a graphics card, then it's probably not worth the effort of trying out an alternative solution like AMD Radeon RX 480 and GTX 1080 Ti (or any other high-end GPU).","The answer to this question depends on your perspective.

If you are a Microsoft fan, then the choice between HP and IBM will be easy. But if you prefer IBM, then it may not matter which one you choose. In fact, I would say that both companies have their strengths in certain areas. For example, HP has been able to develop software for managing large data sets while IBM’s strength lies in its ability to design and build highly reliable computers. Both companies also offer products with excellent customer support. However, there are some areas where they differ significantly. Here are my top three reasons why I like HP: 
 
 1. They make great products. When people think about “best software”, what comes first is quality. Software developers need to know how to write code so as to produce quality software. This means knowing how to use tools such as IDEs, debuggers, etc. To do this, they must understand programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, and object orientation. These skills help them create high-quality code.","The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re talking about a company with more than $1 billion in annual revenue, then the choice between HP and IBM isn’t really an easy one. But if your goal is simply to make money for yourself, then it’s hard not to choose HP. And that’s because of its strong software business, which includes such products as Lotus Notes and Quicken. In fact, there are many reasons why people might prefer one over the other. For example, it can be difficult to find good information online when searching for something like a new car. So while some websites will tell you how much horsepower you’ll get from any given car, others may say things like, “The car has a top speed of 30 miles per hour,” or, “A typical gas tank holds enough fuel to drive 100 miles.” 
 
 On the other hand, there’s no way around it: You need reliable data to plan ahead and buy insurance. When buying insurance, you want accurate information, so you don’t have to worry about getting ripped off.","The answer to this question depends on what you think of as a “better” company. For me, it comes down to the value that I get from my time at both companies. In many ways, they are very similar. Both companies have been around for decades, and their products continue to be used by millions of people. They also share an emphasis on customer service over product innovation. But while HP has always had its own unique brand identity, IBM has never really tried to create one. Instead, it’s focused almost exclusively on selling software products. This means that IBM’s business model relies heavily on sales through direct mail marketing, which can lead to some pretty expensive mistakes. And although IBM does sell hardware, like servers, in addition to software, most customers don’t buy them because they’re so expensive. They’re bought because they’re cool. So how do these two giants compare? Let’s start with price. While HP sells computers for about $900 per PC, IBM charges $1,800 for each one — that’s more than twice the price of HP.","I have been a fan of HP for many years, but the last few years they seem to be going downhill fast. Their software and hardware are not up to par with their competitors. The new HPE server line looks like it will only get worse. They need to do something about this before they lose more customers. This is an interesting question because there was no mention in your article that you were using VMware ESX as part of your solution. It seems logical that if you’re running Windows Server 2008 R2 then you should use ESX. If not, then why not? Is it just me or does anyone else see any reason to switch from VMware’s solution to Microsoft’s? Hi Brian, thanks so much for all these great articles. I’ve got some questions regarding my current setup. I’m currently on a Dell XPS M1530 laptop which has 4 GB RAM and Intel Core i7 processor (quad core) 2.66 GHz processor.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a big company that has been around for many years, then the choice between HP and IBM will be easy. But if you want to start up in less than five years with no money, then it may not matter which one you choose. You can choose either one, but there should be some kind of trade-off. In my opinion, I think it’s better to go with IBM, because they have more experience and resources at their disposal. They also offer much cheaper prices compared to other vendors. This means that even though you might pay more, you’ll get something better. And as long as you’re using open source software, you won’t need any special software licenses from HP. As far as hardware goes, both companies make good products. However, what really matters is how well these products work together. For example, when we were developing our first product, we used an old version of OpenSolaris called Solaris. It was very difficult to run it.","I'm not sure. I think the best answer to that question would be ""Microsoft."" But it's hard for me, because Microsoft has been around since before we even started using computers in our lives (and maybe ever will). It was a company with an amazing history of innovation and great products; but now they're gone—or at least are no longer there anymore. So what do you make of them all these years later?","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. The best way to determine which company has the most value for you, and what it can do with that money in future years, would be by looking at how much of its revenue comes from software development (and not just hardware). If a computer maker makes more than $100 million per year selling products based off their own work as well — even if they're only making about 10% of those sales through licensing deals like HP's Enterprise Linux license deal— then there are likely many other companies who make less profit because people don't want them anymore; but these aren't all good things either.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" In the case of HP, it's a matter of whether they're more efficient than other companies. But in general, if your company has an advantage over others that makes them less likely (or even impossible) for competitors and their customers—say because there are fewer people working at all times; when those jobs become available again after years spent doing nothing but running software development projects with little regard whatsoever about how much time each person spends coding); then maybe one day everyone will be able work together as developers instead! It would also make sense from my point Of view not just why we should have such great productivity growth rates among our employees who can't get paid enough--it could explain some things I've heard elsewhere too...but let me give another example where something like these might seem obvious....I'm sure many readers know exactly which products do best under certain conditions/timescale scenarios - so here goes......","I've been thinking about this for a while now. I'm not sure what to make of it, but the idea that you can get away with something like ""just go ahead and do some research"" seems pretty silly at best (and probably counterproductive).

The company's CEO, John Chambers, was recently asked about the future of computing and he said that ""we're going nowhere."" He also stated in an interview with Wired magazine last year that there are no plans for Apple products like Siri (which would be based on Android) as well because it will only work if you have access from your iPhone 5S Plus device which could mean more than just using voice commands but rather being able use them through other apps such Async/Asynchronous programming languages instead of having their own separate app store where they can get started without needing any additional hardware support at all!"

On the other side, microsoft is easier, faster, cooler.","I am a big fan of both Microsoft and Apple. However, the reason why I prefer Windows over Mac OS X has to do with my personal preference for using programs that are more user friendly than those on Windows. For example, in Windows, you can use any program as long as it works well enough without requiring too much technical knowledge. In contrast, Macs require some knowledge about computers before they will work properly. This makes them less appealing if you’re not familiar with computers. Also, there aren’t many applications available yet which run better on Mac. The only thing that’s comparable between these two operating systems is their ease of use. If all your computer needs is to be able to open up an Excel spreadsheet and have it work, then it’s probably best to stick with Windows. But if you need something more, like being able to play games such as World Of Warcraft or StarCraft II, then go ahead and choose one of them. Which Operating System Is Better At Gaming? There isn’t really anything new here.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a Microsoft fan, then I can see why the two companies would be in such close competition. However, if you have an iPhone and want it for its unique features, then Google has more than enough reasons to beat Apple. In fact, there might not even be any reason at all. For example, Android phones don’t support NFC (Near Field Communication). This means that when someone wants to use their phone as a credit card reader, they need to connect it with a special dongle which costs around $30. And while Apple’s iPhones do allow users to pay using NFC, it’s still only available through third-party apps like PayPal. So what about Google’s Nexus 5X smartphone? It also doesn’t offer NFC support, but instead uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology instead. That means, unlike Apple, Google could easily integrate BLE into future versions of Android.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a computer with great battery life, then go for an iMac. But if you just need something light and portable, then get a MacBook Air. The only thing it lacks in terms of performance is its screen resolution. However, since it’s not as expensive as other ultrabooks, you can always buy one later on. And even though there isn’t much difference between the two models, they both have excellent keyboards. Which laptop should I buy? There aren’t many choices when it comes to ultraportable laptops. You could choose either the HP Spectre x360 13 or Lenovo Yoga C930 13, but those laptops don’t offer any special features. They also cost more than $2000. For your money, you will definitely be better off buying a cheaper model like the Acer Aspire S7-395P-6688. It has all the same features as the Spectre x360, except it costs less than half of that.","The answer to this question depends on the type of business you run. If you’re a small business, then Microsoft and Apple are both great choices. But if your company has more than one location, then it’s better for you to go with Apple. Why? Because they have an app store that allows users to download apps from other developers. This means that instead of having to buy each individual app, you’ll be able to get all the same ones as long as they’re available in their store. And since there will always be new apps, it makes sense to use them rather than buying them. In addition, because Windows Phone 8 runs on ARM processors, which can run faster than x86 chips, developers won’t need to worry about compatibility issues between different versions of Windows. Developers also don’t have to deal with licensing fees like those associated with Android phones. Finally, since Windows Phone 8 uses its own operating system, there’s no need to install any additional software onto your phone. You just pop out the battery cover when you want to charge it. How do I know this?","I think the answer to that question depends on what you consider a “better” browser. If you’re looking for something more than just a browser with some basic features and functionality, then Google Chrome might be your best bet. However, if you’d rather have an entire web experience tailored specifically towards you, then Microsoft Edge may be right up your alley. Both of these browsers are designed around their respective operating systems, so they can work together seamlessly. In fact, both Chromebooks support Windows 10 as well. While this means you’ll need to install them separately, it’s worth it in order to get all the benefits of working together. Which Browser Is Right For You? There isn’t really one single choice when choosing between browsers. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but there are definitely things about each that make it stand out from the rest. Here are my top five favorite Firefox alternatives based solely upon personal preference. 1. Vivaldi – The main reason why people use Firefox. It’s fast, easy to use, and offers tons of features.","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. If you're a Windows user, it's probably best for the latter because they can easily get into trouble with their own OS and have access to all of its features without having any other choice (like an operating system). But if someone else has more experience in Linux than I do, then that would be great too!","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have always had very different approaches, and they've never really worked out how best for their respective industries.","The answer to this question can be found in the following chart. The first two columns are a comparison of apples and oranges, while the third column shows how much difference between them would make if they were both available at once (i-e., one apple equals another). This graph compares each company's performance on these three metrics by year over time using data from their respective companies' annual reports for 2013–14. In other words — as you might expect with such an extensive list—Apple has been performing worse than its competitors since 2009 when it was still just under $1 billion ahead of Google but only about half that behind Amazon Prime Video, which had more revenue per share last quarter compared against 2014 revenues alone ($934 million versus 1.5 percent) according To understand why some people think Samsung should have taken advantage thereof rather quickly I will briefly explain what exactly makes up ""Samsung"" vs.""Microsoft"".","The answer to this question depends on how you define ""better"". The most common definition of a good software product comes from the fact that it's more than just an app. It also includes features and functionality, such as security updates, bug fixes (such Async Task Manager), support for third-party apps like Google Play Music™, Spotify®, Pandora® and many others; new music services including iTunes Radio & SiriusXM Satellite radio with its own streaming service in addition to all other digital media providers which are available through their respective platforms at any time during your visit by visiting www://www2chsolutions.com/applications/.","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. In the case of Windows, it's probably not a good idea for anyone else because they're going to have their own operating system and there are no other options available that would make sense in an office environment where everyone has access to all your data (including personal information). The best way to do so with any OS might be by using one-click installers like Arch Linux which can easily get installed from anywhere but MacOSX as well as Ubuntu/Debian based distributions such Aspire etc.. It also makes installing software easier since most people don't need them at first unless something goes wrong when trying out new features without having had time off work due back home after school… If I'm doing my job right now then maybe some things will change if someone comes up against me making changes while working remotely rather than just running into problems manually!"

Yet, ibm should also be noticed for it is: warranty, conditions, easier to understand.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a computer that can do everything and does it all well, then the choice between an iMac and an IBM PC might be obvious. But if you just need something for basic computing tasks, such as web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, etc. then the choice of either machine will do. For those who have more demanding needs, however, there may not be any other choice. In terms of price, both machines come in at about $1500 which includes the monitor, keyboard, mouse, power supply, etc., but they also include a free copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements 5. This software allows users to create digital art from their photographs. It has been used by many professional photographers around the world including Ansel Adams, Robert Capa, David Hockney, Andy Warhol and others. You get one year of complimentary use with your purchase so you won’t even pay shipping costs.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is simply to get a better understanding of how machines work, then IBM and Apple will be fine. But if you want to understand why they work in such different ways, then it may not matter which company wins out as long as both companies can provide an answer. The problem with machine learning today is that there isn’t much data available about it. There aren’t many papers written by people who have done significant research into it, so we don’t know whether it’s really possible for us to learn something from machines. We also can’t tell exactly when we’ll need machine-learning techniques because there’s no way to predict when they’ll become useful. And even though we’re able to use machine learning, our results often depend heavily on human judgment. For example, one study found that only half of all medical images were correctly classified using machine learning.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is a high performance machine, then yes, go with Apple. However, if you want something that will be used for everyday tasks, and not just gaming, then choose an IBM machine. The reason why they have such great machines is because of their reliability. They make good products at affordable prices.

 For those who don’t care much about gaming performance, but still need a powerful computer, there isn’t anything better than the MacBook Pro 15. It has all the power you’d expect from any modern laptop, including plenty of RAM and storage. It’s easy enough to upgrade it as well, so it’s worth considering whether upgrading would improve performance. There are, however, two things to keep in mind when buying a new computer. First, you’ll probably never see another computer like it. Second, even though these computers may look great, they’re often built poorly.","The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re talking about the quality of a product and not just its price, then IBM clearly has an edge. But if you’re looking for something more than that, it’s clear which company will be better in your eyes. In fact, I think it would be hard to argue against either company. Both companies have been around since before the PC era, both are based in Silicon Valley, they make great products, and they’re very good at marketing. And while Apple’s products may seem like little more than shiny baubles, their marketing prowess makes them stand out from other tech companies. So how do we know which one is better? Well, let’s look back through history. Here are some examples of where each company’s strengths can be seen today: 
 
 1. Microsoft Office 
 
 Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet program was first introduced with Word 97. Since then, Microsoft has added new features such as OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is a high performance machine that can handle multiple tasks at once, then an Intel processor will be fine. However, if you want something more powerful and with better battery life, then it might make sense for you to go with Intel. The same goes for graphics cards. For example, when playing games, Nvidia cards tend to perform better. In fact, they have been known to outperform AMD in some cases. This means that, even though there may not always be a direct correlation between price and performance, there should still be one. So, which one do you prefer? Let us know in the comments. TL;DR A new study shows that consumers prefer buying computers from companies who offer higher prices than those offering lower prices. 5 Ways To Get More From Your iPhone Apps [PICS] 
 When we first reviewed Apple’s iOS 7 operating system last year, many of our readers were disappointed by its lack of significant changes over previous versions.","The answer to this question depends on the context. The two companies are both big players in computing, and they have a lot of money together — $1 billion for each company (and about half that amount from their own investments). But it's not clear how much more you can get out if your business model changes over time as well; there may be other factors at play here too. For example—if one has an iPhone 6S Plus with Retina display technology installed then perhaps some combination will work best but only when paired with another phone running iOS 7/8. Or maybe even just using Android phones instead because those devices don't support natively supported graphics cards like Samsung does today!","The answer to that question has always been the latter. The two companies have a long history of working together, and they've worked hard on many different things in their respective fields over time — from software development to computer vision for example; but at this point it's clear why Microsoft would be best served by having one company with its own unique strengths rather than another like Google (and perhaps even Facebook).","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The two companies have always had very different philosophies on how they should approach the world of computing and it's clear that both are working towards something similar, but at what cost for their respective industries (and especially in terms ""Apple vs."" Microsoft""). But there was one thing I found interesting about these developments – namely, some things were not as obvious when compared with other technologies like Google Glass which we saw earlier today…but now you can see why! ""I'm sure many people will be surprised by my findings,"" said Steve Jobs during his keynote speech last year where he discussed various aspects related specifically between technology giants such Asperger Syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had strong ties with the U.S., and they are both in close proximity, but their relationship was never as friendly at first glance — until now. In an interview published on Wednesday by Bloomberg Businessweek, CEO Tim Cook said that he would not be surprised if Microsoft's share price fell sharply during his tenure there (see chart below). He also noted that while it may seem like Google could benefit from some of its own innovation efforts here instead—and even though we're talking about Android right next door for example—it will likely take more than just one company getting involved into something new every day; rather, many other tech giants should start looking around too closely each year before deciding whether any particular technology can really make them stand out among others when compared against competitors' offerings today.","The answer to that question will be a resounding yes. The two companies are both in the top 10 of their respective industries, and they have been making great strides toward building on each other's successes over recent years — though it may not always work out as well for them if you're looking at one company alone (or even just comparing apples). But there has never been any doubt about what makes these three different brands tick; I'm sure many people who've used either brand would agree with me here when asked whether this was an accurate comparison between Microsoft and Google/Apple."

 In terms of range, the Nissan has an advantage over its rivals. It can go about 100 miles between charges, while both the Audi A3 and BMW i3 only manage around 50 miles. However, it’s worth noting that these figures include recharging stations which could add up quickly. And although the range isn’t as good as some other electric cars, it still beats most petrol cars. It’s also important to note that the Nissan doesn’t need any sort of battery pack – all power comes directly from the battery. This means there’s no danger of overheating when using it. You won’t get much better than that.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from a car. If you’re looking for the ultimate driving experience, then you’ll be happy with either of these two brands. But if you’re more interested in practicality, then Renault has got your back. Its new C-Max and E-Class are both excellent examples of how electric cars can perform well when they have good range and low emissions. These models also offer great value at their price point. Both brands will get plenty of attention this year as automakers try out different battery technologies and look into ways to improve performance. And while it’s true that some people may prefer one over another, there really isn’t much difference between them. In fact, it might even make sense to buy an EV rather than a conventional car because its batteries last longer. That’s why we think buying an EV, especially a plug-in hybrid, makes sense. We tested each model against our own test track using real-world driving. Our goal was to find out which vehicle would do best in terms of range, performance, handling, handling feel, and price.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car that will get you where you need to go in an efficient and economical manner, then Renault might be worth considering. But if you’d rather have something that’s more fun to drive than efficient, then Nissan may also make sense. The same goes with Volvo, which has been around since before the first cars were sold here – it’s not exactly known as being one of the most fuel efficient. And while it does offer some great features, like its excellent handling and low price, there are other options out there. For example, Ford Fiesta offers plenty of power and performance at a very affordable price. It can even compete against many European sports cars. However, if you prefer luxury over efficiency, you’ll probably opt for either BMW 3 Series or Mercedes S-Class. In fact, both models come standard with all kinds of high-tech features such as heated seats, air conditioning, etc. You just can’t beat them when it comes to driving pleasure. Which brand do you prefer?","The answer to that question depends on what you want from a car. If you’re looking for the ultimate driving experience, then you’ll be happy with either of these two brands. But if you’d rather have something more refined, like an SUV or crossover, then go with Nissan. And if your budget doesn’t allow for both, then Renault will do just fine. Both brands offer great value in their entry-level models, and both are known for being reliable vehicles. In fact, they even make some pretty cool cars as well. Check out our list below to see which one might work best for you. Buying Options 
 
 For those who don’t mind paying extra money for a premium car, there aren’t many other options when it comes to SUVs than the Chevrolet Tahoe. This mid-size crossover has been around since 2007, but it’s still going strong. It offers plenty of room inside its spacious cabin, plus enough cargo space for hauling gear without feeling cramped.","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The two companies have both made significant strides in the past few years, but they've also struggled with their own performance issues and reliability problems as well. In fact it's hard to imagine any of them being able even close to what we're seeing today from Mercedes-Benz (NASDAQOTH) for its next generation supercar — which will be powered by an electric motor instead! So while there are some good things going on here at NHTSA this year I think you'll find yourself wondering how much more reliable these cars can get if not just delivered faster than ever before…and why would anyone want one when all those other options aren't available yet?","The two companies have been in the same boat for years. The company has always had a strong relationship with its customers, and it's no surprise that they're now working together on new products such as their latest GT-R electric car (pictured above).","The answer to this question comes down the pike. The two companies have been in a similar position since 2008, when they were both bought by Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz for $1 billion each (the latter was sold as ""Mercedes""). Both of these cars are now considered more valuable than their rivals because it's cheaper—and therefore easier on them to drive; there's no need that you buy one if your car has an engine with less power output compared against its competitors' engines. But while some people might argue about whether such comparisons make sense today versus what we've seen before, I think most would agree those who say so should be able tell us something else entirely different from how things used up over time at VW/Daimler AG after 2007–08. And even though many analysts believe BMW will continue to dominate sales growth through 2016, my personal opinion remains unchanged between 2009 & 2015.","The answer to that question depends on what you mean by ""better"" than the other two. The first, which I'll call Nismo (which means 'good') and Mercedes-Benz (meaning 'great'), are both very good cars at their best; they're also quite different from each others' strengths in terms of performance but still have a lot in common – for example, there's no doubt about it because all three were built with an engine designed specifically for them as well!","The answer to that question depends on where you live. In the United States, there are two major automakers — Ford and GM — which make a lot of cars for both markets (and have been doing so since at least 1970). The other one has more than half its workforce in China; it's also home-grown with an estimated 1,000 employees worldwide who work under contract as contractors working alongside local government officials from all over Asia/Pacific countries like Japan, Malaysia etc., according Toews' data. And while some companies may be able offer lower prices by offering less labor costs per car sold compared directly with their competitors, many others will not because they don't want to compete against them either way : Honda Motor Co.'s ""luxury"" model offers about $1 million cheaper fuel mileage when combined With this caveat I can say without any doubt we're talking about something quite different here! If your company doesn´t sell gasoline based products then what does?"

If you want a phone that has great battery life, but also can handle some moderate gaming and video playback then Motorola Moto X Play will be your best bet. But if you prefer something more powerful with better camera performance than its predecessor, then it might make sense for you to go with Nokia. The only thing we know about the new smartphone right now is that it’s going to have an 8-megapixel camera, which should give us enough room to take pictures of our friends in their underwear. And since we’re talking about Nokia, we’ll just say this: We love it. Like all other smartphones out there, the Nokia 8 Plus comes with two rear cameras, one at the back and another at the front. These cameras come equipped with optical image stabilization (OIS) technology so they work well even when you’re taking photos while wearing sunglasses. You won’t get any blur from these cameras. In fact, you’ll probably see less blurring because there isn’t as much light hitting the sensor.","I have been using the Motorola Droid for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with it. The screen resolution is excellent, it has an excellent camera, good battery life (lasts all day without charging), great keyboard layout, etc. It does not feel like a cheap phone at all. However, there are some things that bother me about this phone. First, as others have mentioned, the camera takes terrible pictures. Second, when you use Google Maps to find your way around in unfamiliar areas, the GPS will sometimes take you on circuitous routes even though you know exactly where you're going. Third, if you want to do anything more than make calls, you'll need to buy a data plan. Fourth, while it's nice having a physical keyboard, typing messages can be difficult because the keys aren't raised enough. Fifth, there's no headset jack. Finally, although the speaker sounds good, music playback isn't great. All these problems could easily be fixed by making the phone thinner, but then again, so would many other things. In short, I'm still waiting for something better from Nokia.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a phone that can do everything and has great battery life, then Motorola might be your best bet. However, if you just need something with good call quality for making calls, text messaging and browsing the web, then Nokia will probably work better than any other phone. The only thing missing from both of these phones would be an FM radio. You can’t have everything. How long does it take to charge my phone? This one was really hard for me to answer. My experience varies depending on how much data I’m using at the time. For example, when I use more data, like streaming music over Bluetooth, it takes about 3 hours to charge. When I don’t use as much, such as playing games online, it usually charges in less than 2 hours. Do you get 4G LTE coverage? Yes, T-Mobile offers 4G. It works pretty well here too. But remember, it’s not perfect.","I think that the best thing for both companies would be to merge into a single company. The reason why this will not happen in my opinion is because of two reasons. First and foremost it does not make sense from an economic point of view. If you have one company with its own brand then there are no other competitors on the market which means they can charge whatever price they want without any competition. This also applies if you look at the mobile phone market. There are only three major players who control 90% of the market, namely Apple, Samsung and Nokia, so merging them all together would mean that each of these companies could sell their phones under different brands but still compete against each other. In addition, by combining the two companies, Motorola has more leverage over Nokia. It makes perfect business sense, especially since Apple already owns some parts of Nokia’s business. However, as much as I love Android, I don’t see how Google could ever join forces with them. They wouldn’t even need to merge. Android users aren’t exactly loyal towards Google.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a phone that can do everything and have great battery life, then go with Nokia. But if you just need something for calling, text messaging and some web browsing, Motorola might be your best bet. The Moto X has better specs than the iPhone 6 Plus but it also costs more. It will cost $199 more in Canada when it’s released later this year. And while the price of the iPhone 6S may seem like an easy decision at first, you’ll find out why after buying it. In my opinion, the only real advantage of going with the Moto X+1 over the iPhone 5C is its camera. While both phones offer excellent cameras, they don’t really stand up against each other. So which one should you buy? Read on. Camera Specifications 
 
 Both cameras take pictures using the same sensor technology as Apple’s iPhones. They use two main components: a 12-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel sensor.",I'm not sure.,"The answer to this question depends on which you ask. The two companies have been fighting over the past few years for a unified smartphone platform, and they've both tried their hand at competing with each other in some way – but it's clear that Google has taken an increasingly more aggressive approach towards Android than Microsoft did last year when its Windows Phone was released (and then discontinued). So while there are many similarities between these three platforms, one thing remains very much distinct about them as far back as we can tell.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan of the Lumia 920, then it's probably best that they are both available in one package (the $199 model). However if you want something more expensive and have an alternative phone with less features than what we've seen from other manufacturers like HTC One M9/M8s, there may be some differences between them as well.","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. The two companies have been in the news lately for their efforts at making phones that are more affordable, but they're not exactly known as a ""mobile phone company."" They've also made some pretty big bets with Android Wear and other smartwatches (like Samsung's Gear VR), which has led to many of these devices being sold out quickly by consumers rather than having them shipped off-line like most smartphones do today — even though it was rumored back then there would be no such thing! But if your smartphone isn't going to cost $100/month from now until 2020 when all those new features will come along, what does one need anyway?","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. The two companies have been working together since the beginning of their partnership, and they've both made some pretty impressive strides in terms (and cost) over the years – but there's no denying that these are still very much a work-in progress project at best."

However, sigma has pluses too. Sigma lens are much cheaper than nikon and much larger in diameter next im planning to buy the 55-200mm Sigma.In practice this Sigma has more color fringing and is fuzzier in the corners than my Nikon 18-200mm zoom, oh well.This Sigma is softer than my Nikon 18-200mm VR when stopped down, especially in the corners.","I came to the conclusion that nikon is better, because: cheaper, sharper, higher. But you should know that sigma is: larger, fuzzier, softer.","I have been using the Sigma 10-20 for a few months now and it has not disappointed me at all. The lens focuses quickly on my D7100 and produces sharp images. It also feels very solid in your hand with no flex whatsoever. This makes shooting much more comfortable than other lenses that are heavier but feel like they might break if you drop them. If you want to shoot sports this is probably one of the best options out there. For those who don’t know, the Sigma 10-30 f/2.8 EX DG HSM Art Lens was released last year. It’s an excellent alternative to the Canon EF 24-70 f/2.8L IS USM. Although it’s slightly slower compared to Canon’s lens, it’s still quite fast enough to capture some great shots. You can read about its performance here. Conclusion 
 
 In conclusion, there really isn’t any reason why anyone would buy another brand when buying a lens. There are plenty of good quality alternatives available from both manufacturers such as Nikon, Canon, Sony etc.","I am not a professional photographer. But for me the Sigma DP1 has been an excellent camera and it was worth every penny. It takes great pictures in low light situations. The only problem with this camera, which many people have complained about, is that you cannot use filters on it. This can be solved by using a polarizing filter to protect your lens from scratches. If you are looking at buying a DSLR but don’t want to spend much money, then buy this. You will love it.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/09/03/bc-bc-marijuana-legalization-legislation.html

 B.C. 's Liberal government, facing mounting pressure over its plan to legalize marijuana, said Thursday it would move forward with plans to regulate marijuana sales while also working toward creating new rules around driving under the influence.","I am not a professional photographer and have no idea what the difference between Nikon, Canon and Sony is. But my wife has been using her D90 for several years now with great results. She uses it mostly in auto mode but also likes to experiment with manual settings. We are both very happy with it. And she loves that you can use any lens on it, including old lenses. The only thing we would change about our camera is if there was an option to shoot RAW files. That way we could get more control over how much noise reduction we want applied. My first digital SLR was a Fuji X100 back when they were still called Fujifilm SLRs. It had all of these features plus a built-in flash which made shooting at night so easy. When I upgraded from this model to the newer model, I found myself wishing I'd kept the older model. It's just too easy to accidentally hit one of those buttons while taking pictures -- especially since it's always ready to go. I'm glad you're enjoying your new camera.","I have been using the Sigma 10-20 for a few months now and it has not disappointed. The image quality of this lens is very good in my opinion. It focuses quickly on both DX and FX cameras with no problems. This was especially true when shooting at f/2.8. There are some minor issues that come up from time to time, but nothing too serious. For example, there will be times where you can see dust particles inside the lens, which could cause problems down the road. However, these are easily fixed by cleaning it. Another issue that comes up occasionally is vignetting around wide open aperture. If you shoot at f/2.8 then you should expect this. Also, if your camera does not support autofocus, then you might experience some vignetting. These two things do happen rarely, so they shouldn’t affect most people. Overall, I’m happy with this lens. It’s definitely one of Nikon’s best lenses. Conclusion 
 
 In conclusion, this article covers all aspects of the new 24-70 f2 GM II zoom lens.","I have a D7100 and the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 Art lens for my Nikon. The images are very sharp with good contrast. My only complaint about this lens would be that it does not focus as fast as the Nikon lens. However, if you want to shoot at 1/500th of second then it’s fine. If you need faster focusing than that, go get an AF lens.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/opinion/sunday/the-republican-party-is-dying.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0

 WASHINGTON — THE Republicans were supposed to win in 2016. They had been on top since President Obama took office eight years ago. But after their convention last week, Donald J. Trump was declared the party’s presumptive nominee. And now his campaign has imploded.","The best for me, and I'm not sure if it's the right lens. The Canon EOS Rebel T1i has a much more compact design than most of my other lenses (and that includes some very good features like auto focus), but they're still pretty expensive to buy at all!","The answer to this question depends on your lens. If you're looking for a more compact, lightweight and affordable camera that's capable of shooting at full frame rates (and with the right lenses), then it might be worth considering an inexpensive DSLR like Canon EF-S 18mm f/2L IS II Lens if there are any advantages over its cheaper competitors in terms ""compact"" size versus smaller sensor sizes such as 35 mm equivalent cameras which can shoot up through 1 meter without compromising image quality due their larger aperture blades compared from ISO 100 - 200 where they have less noise than comparable sized sensors but still offer excellent performance when used indoors while also being able take pictures very well even under high light conditions!","The best thing to do with your camera, if you're going for a more affordable option. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and the Sony A7 are both excellent cameras that offer great value at an incredible price point compared to other DSLRs on this list (and they have some pretty good features too). But there's one big difference between these two lenses – it has less focus distance than most of them out there; in fact, I've seen people say ""it doesn't feel like my lens"" when using their Pentax D800s because those things don' really take up as much space inside what we call our 'lenses'. So while many photographers will be happy to use either Lens 2200-2100 instead… well then why not just buy another pair from Olympus!","The answer to this question depends on your preference. If you're looking for a camera that will be able take pictures with the same quality as an Olympus OM-D EOS, then it's probably best not get one of these cameras because they are more expensive and have less features than their competitors (which means there may be some limitations). However if you want something like Canon EF 50mm f/1.4L IS II Lens which has all its capabilities but also offers many other advantages such in terms ""full frame"" shooting at ISO 100 - 200 I think we can agree about what kind of lens should go into making sure those images look good!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're looking for a camera that's more affordable than the competition, then it may be best if they offer an option with their own lenses and accessories (such as flash)."

But i should tell you that ibm is First of all right now IBM has higher multiple than microsoft.However, IBM has deeper pockets and more patents than Microsoft.But Microsoft knowlege was cheaper then IBM knowlege.","It's a hard decision but I choose microsoft. Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: smarter, bigger, longer, but ibm is: higher, deeper, cheaper","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are doing with your computer. If you’re a gamer, then obviously it’s better for Microsoft. But if you want to do some serious work and need something that can handle multiple applications at once, then IBM will be fine. The only thing they have over MS in terms of performance is their pricing structure. You pay more for an IBM PC than you would for a Windows PC, but it comes with all kinds of extra software like Norton antivirus which costs extra. So while MS has been around longer and offers more software, its price point is higher too. For most people, who just use one program at a time, it’s not really worth paying more. Which operating system should I use? This is where things get tricky. There are two main choices when choosing between OSes. One option is whether you prefer Linux or Windows. Another choice is how much RAM you need. In general, people tend to go for the OS that’s cheaper because they’re used to having less RAM.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from your operating system. If you’re a power user who wants the latest and greatest software with all of its bells and whistles, then Windows 10 will be perfect for you. But if you’d rather have something more like an Apple device, you’ll probably prefer Android. In fact, it’s not even clear which OS would best suit most people. While both Android and iOS are open source platforms, they each come in different flavors — so it makes sense that some people might find one better than another. And while there aren’t many major differences between them, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. For example, Apple’s iPhone 7 has been criticized by reviewers because of poor battery life, but that’s hardly unique to Apple. Other phones also suffer from similar problems, including Samsung’s Galaxy S7. So how do we know which phone is right for us? We can look at our own personal preferences. Are we looking for a smartphone that runs every app out there?","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a Windows user, then the choice between these two companies will be clear. But if you want to use Linux in some way, and especially if you have an old computer that runs Windows, then it might not make sense for you. There are many reasons why people choose one over another – but I think they all boil down to personal preference. For example, there are those who prefer using their own operating system rather than Microsoft’s Windows. And others who like switching from one OS to another. In either case, it’s important to remember which option suits them best. So what should you do? Well, first things first, don’t get stuck with any particular OS. You can always switch back and forth as often as you’d like. However, if you’re looking at buying new hardware, I’d recommend sticking with Linux. It has been around longer and, more importantly, it offers much better support for older hardware such as PCs. As such, you’ll find fewer problems when upgrading it.","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is simply to make a few dollars from the sale of software and hardware, then IBM will probably be better. But if you want to sell more than just software, then it might not matter which company you choose. In fact, in some cases, both companies may offer better value for money. For example, when buying an operating system, you can get Windows 7 Home Premium with Office 2013 included at no extra charge. This means that even though its price tag is higher than other versions of Windows, you still save money by getting all three programs bundled together. On top of that, there are many free upgrades available through Microsoft’s website. And while most people don’t need any additional features, they do have access to lots of useful add-ons such as OneDrive cloud storage and Cortana voice recognition. These features add up over time so it’s worth paying attention to how much you spend each year. Which version should I buy?","I think the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better”. If you’re talking about a better user experience, then IBM has been doing it for years and MS hasn’t done anything yet. But if you’re talking about how well they can compete with each other, then it’s clear that IBM will win in most cases. The only thing that’s going to be really interesting here are which companies have managed to make their products better. In my opinion, both of these companies should do more research into other people’s problems before releasing new products. They need to understand why people use certain features and not others. And they also need to learn from others mistakes. For example, when Windows 95 was released, many users complained because there were no keyboard shortcuts. This turned out to be an important feature – but nobody had thought about it. So now we have keyboards shortcut keys everywhere. It’s very hard to find something wrong with that. So, while I’m still holding onto my old XP machine, I’ll probably switch over to Linux at some point in the future.","I'm not sure. I think it's a good question, but there are some things that you can do to make your business more efficient and less expensive by using the right tools (and sometimes even doing so with an open mind). One of them is making money from selling products on eBay for free – which means if someone buys something at Amazon then they're getting paid in cash rather than just being able buy stuff online as opposed only having access through their bank account once every few months! This way people who use these services have no need either because most sellers don't want customers paying extra fees when buying items directly out-of–date via ebay…or maybe this would be great news too since we'd all like our purchases made instantly without any hassle whatsoever 🙂 The other thing about running businesses requires lots work; often times those hours will come after working long periods while trying different tasks such upsells etc..","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. The two companies are both very different in their approach and approaches, but the similarities end there for me as well. I'm not sure what's more important than a good product that can be used by millions of people around the world – especially if it has an amazing user base (and even then only about 10% will actually use one).","This question has been asked many times before, and it's always a good idea to ask. But this time around I wanted something different from what we've seen in the past with Windows 8 – one that was more focused on performance than features (like multitasking). We're going back to our original goal of making sure you get all your apps running at full speed without having any lag between them when they are launched together as part ""Windows"" app for each device; not just an occasional crash but also some very important things like how much memory can be used by both devices while still being able see which applications have their own windows shortcuts available through those same shortcut keys if needed during startup/shutdown respectively!","The answer to this question depends on which company you're talking about. The two companies that have the most success in terms of productivity are both based around their own products, and they share a common goal for what it means when people work together as an organization—to create something new every day with each other's help (and sometimes even more). But there has been some debate over whether these goals should be shared by all organizations at once; if so why not just use one another instead? And how do we make sure our teams can collaborate effectively without having too many conflicts between them while also being able ""justify"" those differences within us through teamwork rather than conflict-of–interests issues like management disputes where everyone gets involved but no matter who wins out…or worse yet – disagreements among members!","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better"" than the other two. The most common way of looking at it, though not necessarily a good one, would be that they are both more powerful and perform much worse in terms (and performance) than their competitors do when compared against each another. In fact I think we can agree with our own research about how well these companies have performed over time because there's no doubt some people who work for them will say something along those lines as opposed just saying so themselves — but if your goal isn't getting paid less per hour then maybe consider doing an experiment where someone else gets all kinds out-of-""unfair."""

If you want a phone that can do everything and does it well, then go with Apple. But if you just need something for calling and texting and some browsing, then Sony will be your best bet. The Xperia Z1 Compact has great specs at an affordable price. It also comes in black, which makes it look more like a smartphone than other phones out there. And it’s not as big as many of its competitors. It’s actually smaller than my old iPhone 5. So while it may seem expensive, you’ll get all the features you’d expect from a high-end smartphone.

 We have reviewed several smartphones over the past couple years, but we haven’t really focused much on them until now.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a device with great battery life, go for an iPhone. But if you need something more portable, then look at other Android devices. The iPhone has been around since 2007 and it still sells well. It also comes in many different colors. And there are plenty of apps available for it. So while some people might prefer Android, they will be happy with their choice as long as they can get good battery life. Are there any disadvantages of Android? There are, but not many. One thing about Android phones is that they have very limited memory. You can’t install lots of apps. This means that when your phone runs out of memory, you’ll probably end up having to delete all those apps, which takes time. Another disadvantage is that most applications require Internet access so you won’t always find them there. Finally, there’s no way to upgrade the operating system. All new devices come with stock versions of Google applications.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a device that will be used for the next few years, then go with Apple. However, if you are more interested in something that can last longer and have better battery life, then Sony has got your back. In terms of price, we think it would be hard not to choose Sony, but there are other factors which make us prefer Apple’s products. For example, the iPad2 was released at an extremely low price compared to its competitors. This means that people who buy one iPad might feel like they paid too much money when comparing them against their friends. Also, many users don’t care about having the latest version of iOS available as long as they get good performance. We also believe that the new iPhone 5 offers great value for money. It comes with all the features you’d expect from Apple, including the fingerprint scanner, HD screen, fast processor, etc. Moreover, it’s cheaper than any Android phone out there.","I have a Sony Vaio laptop with an i7 processor and 4GB of RAM. It runs Windows 8 very well on the same machine. The only thing that it lacks compared to my old Dell XPS 15 is HDMI output. But for $900 less than what I paid for it, I’m not complaining. And if you want to upgrade your graphics card in the future, just buy another laptop. If you’re looking at buying this computer as a primary computer, then you’ll be happy with it. For me, it’s perfect for surfing the web, watching videos, listening to music, playing games, etc. It’s also great when doing presentations because it has a large screen (16:9) which makes things easier to read. This review was written by Chris from New York. He bought his new MacBook Air 13 inch about two weeks ago. His main reason for choosing the Mac over other laptops was its battery life.","I think Sony has a better chance of winning the console war than Apple. The reason for this is that they have more money to spend on marketing. They also are able to get their games out faster and with less delays. This means that if you buy an Xbox 360 today, it will be obsolete in two years. If you bought an iPhone today it would only last about six months. And so on. So while Microsoft may not win every battle against Apple, there is no doubt that they can beat them at least once in a while. But what does all this mean for gamers? Well, as we said above, most gamers don’t care much about graphics. Most people just want something fun to play. There isn’t really anything else to play these days. So, when graphics start becoming important, then developers need to make sure that the game runs smoothly without any glitches. That means making sure that your computer doesn’t crash during gameplay. It also means ensuring that the player never gets stuck inside a level because he can’t find his way out.","The answer to that question will be a resounding ""yes."" The iPhone 5S and the upcoming Galaxy S6 are both expected by some analysts, but it's not clear whether they'll make much of an impact on sales.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The iPhone 6s and 7 are both the best phones in recent memory, but they're not quite as good. That's because of two things — one being that there isn't much competition for them on price (the other was how well it performs). Both have their own strengths; Samsung had its share of problems with battery life last year when running at 4G speeds while also having trouble getting apps installed quickly enough without losing power during heavy usage like watching movies online from your phone screen rather than using an external hard drive such Aspire VX-Pro3200U2A4P1T6C5E7L8S9F/VHDCP+SDHCI+.","The answer to that question depends on which side you're looking at. The iPhone 5s and the iPad Pro are both built around a single, high-end processor with an 8GB of RAM (the same as your standard 64 GB model). Both have 4K displays but they also feature dual cameras for video recording in 1080p resolution; this makes them ideal candidates for home theater use if it's not possible using multiple monitors simultaneously while still having enough room left over from previous generations of devices such Aspire VX8A3+ models like those sold by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. In addition there are two USB 3.0 ports available - one located under each device slot so users can plug their own cables into these without needing any additional power supply cable attached when plugged directly onto either end – making connecting via HDMI 2.1a/b port easy once again!","The answer to this question has always been ""no."" The iPhone 7 Plus and the new iPad Pro are both great phones, but they're not as good.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" The iPhone 6 Plus and the new iPad Air are both great phones, but they're not as good at multitasking. In fact it's hard for me to see how anyone can justify buying one of these devices over another if you don't have an iPod touch (or any other device). I'm sure there will be some people who want more than just two handsets with their favorite apps on them — especially when that means using your phone in front-facing mode instead! But even though we've seen many times what happens after purchasing multiple iPhones from different manufacturers before getting into something like Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, my personal preference remains between those three models because each model offers its own unique experience without sacrificing functionality either way."
49,Buick,Cadillac,,,,I would prefer buick than cadillac,I would prefer buick than cadillac.,"I think the answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a car with great handling, then Cadillac and Buick, which have been around for decades, will do just fine. But if you prefer something more sporty, like an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Quadrifoglio, then Buick would be your best bet. The Giulia has one of the most powerful engines in its class, as well as some of the nicest handling characteristics I’ve ever experienced. It also costs less than half as much as either of those other two cars. And it comes standard with all kinds of goodies including heated seats, navigation, Bluetooth, satellite radio, power windows, air conditioning, leather seats and, yes, even cruise control. It’s not cheap, but it’s definitely worth it. A version of this article appears in print on, on Page AU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Choosing Between Two Cars That Are Both Great.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a car that will last for years and years, then the Cadillac ATS Coupe may be right up your alley. But if you prefer something more sporty, like the Chevrolet Cruze, then the Chevy Volt might just be the better choice. Both cars have been around since 2009 so they both offer great driving dynamics with excellent fuel economy. However, there are some differences between them. For example, while the Chevrolet has an electric motor in its engine, it uses gasoline as it’s fuel. In contrast, the Cadillac ATS’s engine runs off of natural gas which means that it can run longer without needing any gas. And because the battery pack is located under the floor, instead of being mounted above it, the batteries don’t need to be replaced every time the vehicle needs new ones. This makes them much easier to maintain than their gasoline-powered counterparts. Which one should I buy? There really isn’t too many choices when choosing a car.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a car that will last for years, then the Cadillac ATS Coupe and CTS sedan may be your best bet. They have been around since they were introduced in 2004, but their prices haven’t changed much over time. However, if you like luxury cars with lots of power, then the Buick LaCrosse might be right up your alley. It has an impressive power output at its price point, which makes it perfect for those who don’t mind spending more money than necessary. There are two other models worth mentioning, however. One is the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, which was released back in 2010. This model offers plenty of performance without breaking the bank. Another option would be the Tesla Model S, which started out as a concept vehicle before being launched into production in 2011. While not quite as powerful as some electric cars, it’s still very capable and can get about 60 miles per charge. We hope you’ve enjoyed our list of Best Buys from across America.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a Chevrolet fan, then the Cadillac ATS and CTS will be right up your alley. They have been around for quite some time now, so they should feel familiar. But if you’re looking at buying an ATS, it may make more sense to go with one that has already been in production since 2011. This car was introduced as part of General Motors’ “Big Three” lineup back then, but it’s still going strong today. It offers plenty of performance without breaking any new ground when compared to its competitors. It’s also very affordable, which makes it ideal for those who don’t want to spend too much money on their car. For many buyers, however, there isn’t really anything wrong with either vehicle. Both offer great value for money, especially considering how long they’ve been around. And while both cars can get pretty hot inside, they’re not nearly as bad as people might think. In fact, most buyers seem to like them just fine. So why do we keep comparing them?","The answer to that question depends on what you want from a car. If you’re looking for something that’s more sporty and less expensive, the Cadillac ATS Coupe might be your best bet. But if you prefer luxury with some of the same features as an ATS, then you’ll probably opt for the Buick. Both cars are great value at their current price points, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. For starters, both offer plenty of power in their engines. While the CTS has been updated over the years, it still offers nearly 200 horsepower compared to the ATS’s 250. That means it’s not just about fuel economy, either. In fact, the new CTS-V will get up to 60 miles per gallon highway without using any gas. That’s impressive when you consider how much gas you’d need to fill up. And while the ATS does use its engine more, it also gets better mileage than the CTS. Another difference between the two models is price.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan of the brand, then it's probably best not buy one that doesn't have an engine and has no steering wheel at all (or maybe even just some kind) but instead uses its own powertrain with less than 1/4″ suspension for more stability in traffic situations where there are fewer people around who can drive safely without being hit by cars hitting them from behind.","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. The most common questions are, ""How much do I need?"" and the following ones can be answered by asking a simple yes/no test of your car's performance in terms that will help determine its value as an investment vehicle for many people (and others).","The answer to that question has been a long time coming. The two brands have always had their share of controversies, but the fact remains they are both very similar in many ways. Both cars were built by Chrysler and Ford while each was designed for different purposes – from passenger car sales through luxury vehicles like SUVs to high-end sports sedans such as Rolls Royce's Fords (which also featured an all new interior). In addition there are some differences between them; one looks more upscale than the other because it uses less power at lower speeds compared with its competitors' models which means fewer horsepower on average when driving slower distances due not onlyto higher engine speed limits though this can be mitigated if you're willing/bought into using smaller engines instead so your mileage will go up accordingly!","The answer to that question may surprise you. The two are not the same thing, but they both have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance (and reliability). In fact there's a lot more going on than just what we're talking about here; it also includes some very important things like fuel economy ratings for each car as well!","The answer to that question was a resounding yes. The two cars were the best of their generation, and they both had great performance in every category except for one — powertrains (the other being an all-new V8). But there's no denying how much more powerful these vehicles are than any previous model year car ever made by Chrysler; it took them just over three years to reach peak horsepower levels at full throttle on some models like this new Pontiac Grand Prix GTI Coupe with its 690 hp engine from 2011 through 2014. It also takes less time off work when you're driving those engines as well!"
50,Advil,Motrin,,,,"I would prefer to use advil. Motrin is the newer brand of Ibuprofen but has the same action as that of Advil.Mainly Advil has a thick sugarcoating which takes longer to dissolve than the thin film coating on Motrin, so it will take slightly longer to work.So you could take Advil more often than Motrin since it's smaller doses. But i should tell you that motrin is I have always heard that Motrin is better than Advil for fevers, and that Advil works better for body aches and pains.","Taking into account the benefits of advil (newer, longer, longer to dissolve), it is better. But it will be useful for you to know that motrin is: better for body aches and pains.","The answer to this question depends on the type of headache you have. If your headaches are caused by a virus, then it may be better for you to take an over-the-counter cold remedy such as Tylenol PM than to use prescription medication. However, if you’re suffering from migraine headaches, then it’s best to avoid taking any medication at all and instead rely solely on natural remedies. For example, drinking ginger tea can help relieve pain in some cases. In addition, there have been studies that suggest that eating spicy foods like chili peppers could also help. Is there anything else I should know about headache? There isn’t much more information out there. Headaches aren’t something we really understand very well yet, so there’s not too many things doctors can do to treat them. Most people will just need rest and relaxation techniques until they get better. You don’t want to go overboard with these techniques, though, because you’ll only end up making matters worse. Instead, try focusing on one thing at a time – getting enough sleep, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, keeping stress levels down, etc.","The answer to this question depends on the type of pain you are in. If it is a mild headache, then I would go with Advil. It can be used for moderate headaches and migraines as well. However, if your headache has become more severe, than going with motrin will not help you. You should also consult an experienced doctor before taking any medication. How long does it take to get better? This one was very interesting. When people were asked how much time they took from when their head started hurting until they got better, most said about 4 hours. But some claimed that it takes up to 8 hours to feel better. So, what do we know so far? Well, there have been many studies done in order to find out which medicine works best for different types of pain. Some doctors even suggest using both medicines at once. For example, if someone gets severe headaches, he may use both ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Other times, however, only one medication might work best.","I have a friend who has been taking the two for about 2 months and she says that it works better than either of them. She also said that her migraines are less severe since starting it. Is this true? If so, does anyone know if there was any research done on this? The only thing you can do to help your headaches is take some medicine before bed. It will make them go away faster. You should try not getting up in the middle of the night because then they won’t be able to get rid of you. They might even come back at night. But don’t worry too much cause you’ll feel so bad when you’re having one but it’ll pass soon enough. My husband had a headache last week and he took an aspirin. He felt like his head hurt all day after that. Then we went out with friends and my son got sick. We were both sick too. This morning I woke up feeling really bad. After reading these comments I’m going to see what else I could do.","The answer to this question depends on the type of pain you are dealing with. If your problem is a headache and not an ache in your neck, then I would go with Advil. However, if your issue is more serious than that, then it might be better for you to take something like motrin instead. In fact, there have been studies that show that taking both drugs can help reduce pain. This means that even though they may seem similar at first glance, one drug will work much better. For example, when we compare Advil and ibuprofen, which has only two active ingredients, we see that ibuprofen works faster because it contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen’s effect lasts longer than aspirin’s effect. So, while both medicines do work, their effects last longer. Also, since ibuprofen’s main ingredient is acetylsalicylic acid, it’s easier for people who suffer from headaches to get relief by using it.","The answer to this question depends on the person and their situation. If you are in a car accident with your child, chances are, it will be very difficult for them to get out of the car. This means that they need some kind of pain relief as soon as possible. In addition, if there was an accident, then you may have lost one of your children because he/she has been injured. Therefore, what should you do? You can either take medicine from home which might help you recover quickly but also make things worse by making you feel worse. Or you could go to hospital where doctors would give you more medicines than you need. These two options are not good at all. So, how do we choose between these two? Well, first of all, you must decide whether you want to use medication or not. There are many different types of medications available today so choosing wisely is important. Also, you must consider the type of injury you have. For example, if you had broken bones when your child fell down stairs, then you probably don’t want any sort of medication.","The best way to get started with this product, I think it's the most important one. It has a great price point and you can use any brand of adhesives for your products as long they are well-suited to each application that needs them (like hair care).","The first thing I would say to anyone who has ever tried it, and even if you have never used the product before (or are already using one), this should be a very good idea. It's not as easy for people with allergies like me to get on their own but once they do try something new that works well in your body then there will always come an opportunity when someone else does too! This can happen because of some things we all know about how our bodies work so what makes us feel different from others may change over time depending upon which brand/brand combination suits them best at each stage of development – especially after puberty etc… So here goes…. I've been doing my research into adverts since childhood where most brands were based around 'Advil' rather than other products such Aspire, VivaVidio & Tonic.","The best way to find out if you're getting the right kind of ad for your product, and whether it's a good one at all. It may be hard to decide which brand suits each person well enough that they'll want to buy from them in order not to get caught up with their own personal tastes (and thus have an unfair advantage over others).","The best way to get started with this product, and the one that I use most frequently. It's a great tool for those who are looking for an affordable alternative when it comes time to buy their first car (or even just start building your own).","A lot of people have been asking me about the best way to use this product. I've tried it out and found that there are a few things you can do with your money, but if they're not working for some reason (like when using an old car), then maybe these products aren't worth their weight in gold! And even though we all know how much time goes into making sure everything works as intended – especially since many other brands don' care what brand names come up on our lists at any given moment - here's my advice… Don 'em before buying anything else because once again... make them work!"

If you’re looking for something that’s going to be fast, then go with Nissan. But if your goal is more of an everyday driver, then Ford will do just fine. The same goes for Chevrolet, which has been making cars since 1886, and whose history includes building some of America’s most iconic cars. And while Chevy may not have as many luxury features like leather seats, air bags, cruise control, satellite radio, heated seats or even power windows, it does offer plenty of performance in its lineup. For those who are interested in luxury, there are two other brands worth considering. Both companies make vehicles that can easily run up to 60 miles per gallon, but both also boast impressive fuel economy. In fact, according to Edmunds.com, Chevrolet boasts the best mileage rating among all automakers. That said, it’s important to note that these numbers aren’t based solely on EPA ratings. They include factors such as driving style, tire pressure and engine power. So don’t take my word for it.","The answer to this question depends on how you look at it. If you want a car that can go from 0 to 60 in less than four seconds, then the Ford Focus RS will be your choice. But if you are looking for something with more power, and better handling, then the Nissan GT-R may just be what you’re after. Both cars have been around since 2003, so they both offer plenty of power and handling capability without breaking any new ground. However, there are some things about them that make them stand out above their rivals. For starters, the Ford has an engine that’s capable of producing over 700 horsepower. This means it should easily outpace its rivals when it comes time to push hard into high gear. And while the Nissan doesn’t boast quite as much torque as the Focus, it’s still enough to get up to speed. In addition, the Nissan also offers a number of features not found on other cars, such as automatic climate control, cruise control and stability control. These all add convenience but don’t necessarily improve performance.","The answer to that question depends on what you want your car to do. If you’re looking for a sporty car, the Ford Focus RS will do just fine. But if you prefer something more practical, the Nissan GT-R may be better suited. Both cars are great value and offer plenty of performance at an affordable price. And both have been around since before the first iPhone was released. So it’s not like they’re out of date. Which one would I rather drive: Nissan Leaf vs. Tesla Model S P100D? In terms of performance, the two electric vehicles are very similar. They each get about 100 miles per charge in all-electric mode, which means they can go from zero to 60 mph in under four seconds. They’re also comparable when it comes to range. Neither has any trouble reaching 80 percent charge. On top of that, neither offers much range anxiety, as their batteries last between 40 and 50 miles. That’s enough time to cover most people’s daily needs, but you’ll still need some charging stations along the way.","The answer to that question depends on what you consider a “better” car. For me, the Ford Focus RS was better than either of its rivals. It had more power, it felt quicker, and it looked better. But I also liked how easy it was to drive in my hands – even with gloves on. And while it’s not as fast as some other cars like the Audi R8 V10, it has enough power for most everyday driving. If you’re looking for an all-around great car, then I’d go with the BMW i8. It’s got plenty of performance at low speeds but can handle anything from highway driving through city streets to high-speed slaloms. Its handling feels just right when cruising along at 70 mph without feeling too stiff or harsh. You won’t be able to turn corners quite so quickly because there’s no steering wheel lock, but you’ll still feel comfortable doing so. Advertisement 
 
 That’s why I’m glad we have two different models of each car here at Jalopnik.","The answer to that question depends on the type of car you drive. If you’re a daily driver, then Ford will be your best choice. But if you’re looking for something sporty, you’ll want Nissan. And if you’re someone who wants to drive their vehicle every day, but doesn’t mind paying more than other automakers, then Honda might just be right up your alley. Advertisement 
 
 For those in search of an affordable and reliable car, there are plenty of options out there. Here are some of our favorites: 
 
 Chevrolet Volt 
 
 This plug-in hybrid electric has been around since 2009, so it’s not exactly new. It’s still one of the most popular cars available today, with over 100,000 sold worldwide. It also happens to have great fuel economy numbers. In fact, it gets about 40 miles per gallon city driving (that’s pretty good for a car). That makes this model perfect for people who don’t like having to worry too much about gas mileage.","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes."" The two companies have both made significant strides in the last few years, and while they may not be as good at their jobs (Ford's sales are down from its peak of $1.4 billion), it still makes sense for them — especially given how much money each company spends on marketing itself through advertising campaigns like this one.","The answer to that question depends on the car you're driving. If it's a Honda Civic, for example — which has been around since 1993 and was built by Toyota in Japan before being sold out of production at its current price point (about $1 million) – then there are plenty more options available than what we've seen so far from these two companies' respective brands; but if you want something with an all-wheel drive feel like your favorite sports utility vehicle…well, look no further! The only thing worse would be when they went back into their original design form after selling off parts as part sales proceeds rather quickly due largely to poor customer service issues over time …and now this one comes up again?! ""It looks good,"" says Jeff Leach about his new GTI Sportster Concept model while waiting outside my local dealership last week where he bought some old stock cars online just days ago.","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. The two companies are both very different in their approach and philosophies, but they share a common goal of making the most out your car's performance potential by offering an affordable option for those looking to get into more advanced sports cars that can be customized with all-wheel drive (AWD) technology such as adaptive cruise control systems—a feature found only recently among some automakers like Toyota Motor Corp., Mercedes Benz Group AG and BMW Co Ltd.—and other manufacturers including Audi SA, Hyundai A3 SUV models. Both have been working hard over the past few years developing new technologies designed specifically for AWDs so it will make sense to them if we want our vehicles equipped with these capabilities at prices competitively priced across many categories from low end luxury sedans through high tech SUVs.""","The answer to that question depends on which car you buy. If the two companies are competing for your attention, then it's probably best not to look at them in this light because they're both very different brands and have a lot of similarities (and some differences).","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. The two are not interchangeable, but they do share a common goal of improving the quality and reliability of all vehicles in their respective markets — both have been around for decades now. Both companies believe that by making more efficient use of resources available at lower cost than other automakers (and thus less expensive), consumers will be able buy higher-quality cars with greater value when compared against cheaper alternatives like Toyota's Prius hybrid sedan/crossover system; while also reducing emissions from older models as well as increasing fuel economy through improved efficiency features such Asperger syndrome technology which reduces driving time due only partially because it has fewer side effects during peak periods rather then full throttle after long stints where there may still be some residual energy left over before your car starts up again!"
52,"Ferrari
",Renault,"Renault worse engine and car than McLaren, Red Bull & Ferrari.
In recent years, the team used Ferrari power units, rather than Red Bull's Renault engines.
In recent years, Red Bull has admitted its concerns that the Renault engine is not up to speed with Ferrari and Mercedes.

Renault, largely thanks to Caterham's pounding over the three days compared to Marussia's struggles, is ahead of Ferrari on total laps completed: .10) I hope Renault are strong (essentially a one man team, which is a shame because a better second Renault driver could be taking points away from Ferrari) and I hope Mercedes are strong.The Renault chassis was also a bit better than the Ferrari but where Ferrari managed to get away with it, is that the engine is a lot stronger than the Renault V10 and that means that the overall package which Ferrari had was better than the Renault. I would like to pay attention to the fact that ferrari is Schumi n a slow ferrari would be much faster than Fisi in a fast Renault and I think noone can deny that.It was not really a title fight, but like this seasons wasn't... the 2006 Ferrari was way superior than the 2006 Renault just like the 2012 Red Bull was vastly superior to the 2012 Ferrari.williams say that ferrari and redbull are 4tenths faster than anyone then renault williams sauber and toro rosso with mercedes and mclaren after that.","It's a hard decision but I choose renault. Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: red, points, stronger. However, ferrari is not be ignored, because it is: faster, fight, mercedes.","Links What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? The answer to that question depends on the type of car you are looking for. If you want a sporty car, then Ferrari will be your best bet. But if you prefer something with more power, then Renault might be better for you. Both cars have been around since before World War II and both offer great performance in their respective classes. However, there are some differences between them as well. For example, while Mercedes offers an automatic transmission, Ferrari has one built into its cars. This means they can go from 0 to 60 mph quicker than other automakers. Also, it seems like most people who buy either brand choose the manual transmission because it’s easier to drive at high speeds without having to worry about clutches. In addition, many people find the sound of the engine quieter when driving manually. So which do you prefer? I think you’ll end up going back to Ferrari. Conclusion 
 
 There really isn’t much difference between these two brands besides price. You should always look out for price though, especially when buying used vehicles.","Links What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? I think Renault has a better chance of winning the constructors’ championship than Ferrari because they have more money and are able to spend it on their own team.” 
 
 The FIA president also said that he was not surprised by the decision made at last week’s meeting in Geneva. He said: “I don’t know what happened but we will see how this develops. We must be very careful about any kind of political interference with our sport. It would be bad for Formula One if there were some sort of influence from outside which could affect the way F1 works. This is why we need to keep an eye out for this.” 
 
 In his letter to Ecclestone, Mosley wrote: “Mr Ecclestone has been asked to explain whether he believes that the current situation can continue without significant changes being made. As you know, Mr Ecclestone does believe that, as things stand, the sport needs major changes. However, these don't require him to take action against other people who may disagree with him. That is something he cannot do.","Links What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? I am not sure which one to choose. But it seems that Ferrari has a better chance of winning the World Championship. And they are also more likely to win in the next few years than Renault is. So if you want to be competitive with Ferrari, then you have to choose Ferrari. If you don’t like it, then you can always go back and try another team. Q: You said that Mercedes was “very close” to signing Kimi Raikkonen. Do you think he will stay at Mercedes? Or do you believe that there could be other options? A: There were many options for him. He had an offer from Red Bull but we didn’t accept it. We wanted him here because he’s such a good driver. He’s been doing really well this year. The team has done well. It’s hard to say what would happen now. It depends on how things develop. For now, it’s up to him, whether he’ll stay. That’s his decision. Q: In your opinion, who should replace Felipe Massa as Williams driver? A: Fernando Alonso.","Links What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? I think Ferrari will be the better team in F1 this year. But they have a lot of work to do before that. They need to improve their car and get it back on track. The problem with Renault has been that they’ve had no real engine development for quite some time. They’ve got two engines which are both very old now, so they’re not going to make any significant progress until next season. And then you add into that, as we saw last year, the fact that Fernando Alonso was driving an older car, it’s hard to see how they’ll ever catch up again. So there’s lots of things that can go wrong between now and then. It’s difficult to say who would win if all these factors were taken into account. Q: You said earlier today that your biggest concern about McLaren at present is its lack of pace. How much does that worry you? A: It worries me because I’m sure there are people within McLaren, including Toto Wolff, who want to keep us out of Formula One. If you’re talking about speed, that’s one thing.","Links What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you are a Ferrari fan, then the choice between the two teams will be easy. But if you prefer Renault and Ferrari, then it may not matter as much. Both have been very good in recent years, but they both need more time before their cars can compete with Mercedes. It would take some time, so I think Mercedes should go for Ferrari. They could even get Fernando Alonso from McLaren – he has had an excellent season this year despite his age. He was able to win races at Mercedes, which makes him one of the best drivers in Formula 1. And there is also Sebastian Vettel, who won last year’s title without winning any races. So why not? Q: You said earlier that you were surprised by how well Red Bull did against Williams during practice yesterday. Did you expect them to do better than that? A: No, because we knew what kind of car they had. We expected them to put up a fight like that. There were no surprises there.","What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? The answer to that question depends on who you ask.","What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan of the two, then it's probably best for both teams not to be involved in any way whatsoever with either one (or at least they should). However if you want to see what happens when there are no other options available and don't have an alternative car option as well, consider this article from last year where we looked into how Mercedes might approach their F1 team situation by using its own engine instead than having another driver take over after them - which would make things even more difficult due all three drivers were already working together under similar circumstances so why bother trying to get something done now?! The problem here isn´t just about whether these guys can do anything else but who knows... maybe some sort 'new' idea will come along too!","
 (Photo by Marko Kucic) The two teams have been in a similar situation for some time now. They were both competing at the same level, but they had to settle their differences and find common ground on what was best about each other's cars - something that has never happened before between them since 2003 when Mercedes won its first race with F1 team Red Bull Racing after winning it twice from McLaren-Honda during an early season test drive together as part of Formula One World Championship qualifying sessions last year. But this weekend will be different because there are still many similarities among these three drivers who share one goal – improving performance through hard work rather than just being too good looking; while Williams' new driver Jenson Button may not even get his chance yet again until he gets back into racing mode next month against Honda due to injury issues which could sideline him if needed.","What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? The answer, of course. Both are the most popular cars in Formula 1 today and both have been around for decades now. But what about Mercedes-Benz's latest model – which has a new engine that can be used to accelerate its supercar faster than any other car on offer at this point (and it does)? It looks like we're going back into an era where you could drive your own F1 team without having to pay anything extra because there isn't much else available outside from McLarens' existing fleet. And if they do make their way out onto track with some sort Of Course I'll take them over my old one!","What is better: Ferrari
 or Renault? The answer depends on which one you choose. It's a matter of preference, but it can be done with either car and the difference in performance will depend largely upon how well your team performs at that point – whether they're winning races like last year (or even this season) because their cars are more powerful than Mercedes' engines for example; if not then what about other teams who have been able to do so much faster recently as we've seen from McLarens/Lapis-powered F1 drivers such Asensio Perez vs Sebastian Vettel versus Fernando Alonso…etc etc …). So there may also come an occasion where both manufacturers want to compete against each others engine combinations while still maintaining good racing results despite being different vehicles based on similar characteristics! This would make sense when comparing them all together though since most people think 'well I'm going into next week trying my best', whereas some might say ""I don't know why everyone thinks otherwise""."

Coke (Coca-Cola) over Pepsi.
Warm Coca-Cola tastes better than cold Pepsi.
Here's Why Coca-Cola Is Better Than Pepsi .
Or that Coca Cola taste better than Pepsi.",It seems like coca-cola is better than pepsi because Coca-Cola is more common than Pepsi.Warm Coca-Cola tastes better than cold Pepsi..,"It seems like coca-cola is better than pepsi because it is: mmo, tastes.","The answer to this question depends on the situation. If you are in a situation where your choice of beverage will not affect your health, then Coke may be better than Pepsi for you. However, if you have been drinking soda all day and want something that tastes good, but does not contain any added sugar, then Pepsi might be better. For example, someone who has had one can of coke per day, but drinks diet sodas every day. In such cases, it would probably make more sense to drink Pepsi. But even then, there could still be some benefit from switching to Coke. It seems like both brands taste pretty good when compared with other brands. How much do I really need to drink? There are many different types of beverages out there. Some people prefer water over soda, while others enjoy both. Others just don’t care about what they drink. And so on. This means that, depending upon how often you drink, you should consider whether it’s worth buying two bottles instead of one.","The answer to this question depends on how you look at it. Coke and Pepsi are both carbonated drinks, but they differ in their ingredients. Coca-Cola’s ingredients include sucrose. This means that it contains a lot of sugar. In contrast, Pepsi, which has no added sugar, uses only natural sweeteners like aspartame. These two drinks have similar amounts of calories, and the amount of sugar per serving varies by brand. However, there are some differences between them. For example, Pepsi does not contain any preservatives such as sodium benzoate, while Coca Cola does. Also, soda fountains can be found throughout many parts of the world, whereas most vending machines don't. How much caffeine should I drink? Caffeine is an ingredient used for energy purposes. It helps your body produce energy. If you’re looking to lose weight, then drinking coffee will help with weight loss. But if you’d rather drink something more healthy, try tea. Tea also contains caffeine, so it’s good for you.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from a beverage. Coke and Pepsi are both carbonated drinks, but they differ in their ingredients. Coca-Cola’s ingredients include sucralose, which has been shown by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to be an additive that may cause cancer in humans. Pepsi, meanwhile, contains aspartame, another artificial sweetener that’s not approved for human consumption. In fact, there have never been any studies done comparing the effects of these two drinks. But if you’re looking at your soda choices carefully, you’ll notice one thing about them: They contain different amounts of sugar. That’s because sugar isn’t just added as part of the recipe, it’s also used during manufacturing processes. According to Beverage Digest, “Sugar content varies among sodas.” And while some drinks use less sugar, others add more. For example, Diet Coke’s version uses more than twice as much cane juice per serving as regular Coke, according to the company. So how do we know when something is sweetened with sugars? We can look at its calorie count.","The answer to that question depends on what you consider a “better” drink. Coke and Pepsi are both carbonated drinks, but they have different levels of carbonation. Coca-Cola’s level is about half as much as Pepsi’s, while the amount in each drink varies by brand. In other words, if you’re looking for something with less sugar, you’ll probably want more Coke. If you’re looking for something with more, then try Pepsi. How do I know which one tastes better? It’s simple: You taste it. And that’s why it’s important not only to choose your drinks carefully, but also to compare them side-by-side. For example, when it comes to soda, there isn’t really any difference between the two brands. But there’s definitely an advantage to choosing a soda made from cane sugar over those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Why? Because cane sugar has fewer calories per gram than high fructose. So even though they’re similar in calories, the sugars in these sodas will be different.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from a soda. Coke and Pepsi are both carbonated drinks, but they differ in their ingredients and the way they’re made. Coca-Cola’s main ingredient is sugar, while Pepsi’s primary ingredient is caffeine. Both drinks contain about 50 calories per 12-ounce serving. But if you’re looking for something with more of an energy kick, then you’ll probably prefer Coke. And since it’s made by adding sugar instead of water, it has fewer calories. Which soda do I prefer: Diet Coke, regular soda, diet cola, sparkling water or sports drinks? TL;DR A new study shows how much people drink each day based on which beverage they're drinking. Here's where your choices fall along these dimensions. Why Is Facebook Buying Instagram? Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom says he wants to make sure his company can compete against Facebook. (Photo: AP) 
 
 When Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram last year, its stock price soared. It was one of the most successful tech acquisitions ever.","The answer, of course. The two brands are both great at producing a product that's good for you and your family — but they're not the same thing if one brand doesn't produce something special enough to make it into an actual beverage (or even just as much fun). And while Coke has been around since its inception in 1964, there have always had be some differences between them; from their packaging design to how well each drink was made by hand, all these things can vary wildly depending on what kind people consume with which beverages—and whether those drinks actually taste like soda when consumed alone! In fact many companies still use different types/colors than before because most consumers don' want more flavor combinations out of every single bottle sold…so why should we care about this stuff anymore?!","The answer to that question has been a long time coming. The two companies have always had different tastes and preferences, but the fact of the matter is Coke was one of the first brands in history with an emphasis on flavor over quantity (and it's not just about taste). It also made its mark by being able for consumers who wanted something more than what they were getting at home – like soda water! And while we're talking bottled milk here, I'm sure you've heard stories from people saying ""I want my kids' favorite brand!"" Well…that doesn't mean there aren´t some great options out around as well; if anything this may be why so many are choosing them up front rather then waiting until after school hours when their parents can get back into work.""","The answer to this question depends on who you ask. In the case of Coke, it's a matter of taste and not substance; in other words, if your palate doesn't like what they're tasting then there are no good options for them at all (or even worse). But when I asked my friends about their favorite soda brands – which include Budweiser, Sprite, Dietz, etc., as well - we were told that most people would agree with us based solely upon our tastes alone. So here goes…

 I'm going back into some more detail now because these two companies have been around since before any sort ""soda"" was invented by anyone else but themselves! Here comes one brand from each company whose name has come up quite often over time so let's get started...","The answer, of course. But what about the other two brands that are popular with consumers and who also sell their products in a variety to different tastes (e., ejuice)? Is it possible for Coke's ""better"" brand to be more appealing than its competitor's product line because they're both made by one company rather then another?","The answer to that question has been a long time coming. The first major change in the way we consume Coke was its introduction of artificial sweeteners, which were introduced by Dr. Pepper and other brands as part about 20 years ago (see ""Coke's New Sweetener""). These are essentially sugar substitutes for soda; they're not really any different than what you'd find on your regular sodas today—they just contain more calories per serving compared with their natural counterparts. But there have also been some notable changes since then such be it new flavors like vanilla ice cream from Starbucks, an increase over traditional flavored drinks made using cane juice instead thereof. And now many companies including Nestlé will no longer sell them at all because this would make consumers feel guilty if someone tried one without knowing how much caffeine actually makes up our bodies' metabolism! So why do so few people buy these products anymore when most others can't afford those expensive beverages?!"

On the other side, ibm is stronger, rivals, higher.","I am not a big fan of either company. But then again, neither are most people who have ever owned an IBM PC in their lives. And that has been my experience with both companies. The only thing they seem to share is the name and logo. In fact, if you look at what each company does well, it seems like there isn’t much difference between them. Both companies make computers for businesses but also sell PCs directly to consumers. They do this by selling software on top of these computers. This means that while one might think that Microsoft would be better than IBM, it’s actually not. While Windows 7 was released last year, Vista came out just two years ago. So how did we get here? Well, first off, let’s talk about why we’re talking about “Windows” here. If you’re reading this, chances are, you’ve heard someone say something along the lines of, “I don’t want to use Linux because I’m afraid I’ll lose all my stuff.” That’s probably true. However, that’s exactly what happened when Apple decided to release Mac OS X Leopard.","The answer to that question depends on your needs. If you want a laptop with the best battery life, then go for Dell; if you need an ultrabook that’s light and thin, but still powerful enough to run all of your everyday tasks, then go for IBM. But if you’re looking for something more powerful, look no further than Lenovo. Lenovo has been making some great laptops lately, so it’s worth checking out their latest offerings. This new ThinkPad X1 Yoga will be available in two different configurations: one equipped with Intel’s 8th generation Core i7 processor, which should offer up better performance at lower power consumption while also being faster thanks to its Turbo Boost technology (Intel claims it can boost clock speeds by as much as 20 percent). And another configuration comes standard with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card, giving users plenty of horsepower without sacrificing too many frames per second. Both configurations are powered by NVIDIA’s Maxwell architecture, which means they have four physical cores instead of just two.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a laptop that will last for years and years, then go with Dell. However, if you need something more portable, then look at HP. The HP Envy x360 15 has an Intel Core i5-8250U processor, which means it can handle most of your everyday computing needs. It also comes in two different models, one with 8 GB RAM and another with 16 GB. Both models have a 15.6-inch screen as well. You get both versions of Windows 7 Home Premium, so you won’t be missing out on any important updates. This model also features a fingerprint reader, which makes using the computer even easier. Finally, there is a backlit keyboard for those who like their computers dark. Overall, these laptops offer great value for money. They come equipped with plenty of storage space too. In addition, they feature excellent battery life when compared to other laptops. These machines run very cool too, thanks to the aluminum chassis. That helps them stay cool.","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a laptop with the best battery life and performance, then go for Dell’s Inspiron. However, if you need something more portable than that, then look at Lenovo’s Yoga C930 series. Both of these models have excellent performance in their respective categories. For example, Lenovo has claimed an impressive 13 hours of continuous use when playing games like World of Warcraft while using just one charge. This means that even after 12 hours, your computer will still be able to run without needing any recharging. On top of this, both laptops also boast great graphics performance. In addition, they come equipped with Intel HD Graphics 5100 integrated graphics. These two features make them perfect choices for those who don’t mind sacrificing some power consumption during extended gaming sessions. Should I buy it? There really isn’t much difference between the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, which comes with Windows 10, and its closest competitor, the HP EliteBook Folio 13.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a computer that will run Windows 7 and have an Intel processor, then go with Dell. However, if you need something more powerful than that, such as a gaming computer, then go for IBM ThinkPad. The Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga, however, has been designed specifically for business users who don't require much power. It also comes in other colors, including black, blue, red, purple, green, yellow, orange, pink, white and black. This laptop can be purchased at Amazon from $999. Best Gaming Laptop – HP Pavilion Elite x360 15 Gb 
 
 In terms of gaming, there really isn’t any better option out there. There aren’t many laptops available which offer all these features plus more. For example, it offers NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M graphics card along with 4GB RAM. You get two USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI port, three USB2.0 ports and one SD Card reader.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The only company that can offer the best value for money in its PC business, and one of those companies are Intel. It's not just about price; it also doesn't have any real competition from other manufacturers like HP (which makes laptops) because they're all based on ARM processors with low-power cores which make them more expensive than their competitors' chipsets at $100/core ($200-$300). So if you want an affordable laptop but don�t need high performance graphics cards then there isn`T much point having AMD as your main competitor here either!","The answer to this question depends on which company you're talking about. The best-selling PC maker, Intel (NASDAQOTH), has been the most successful in its field for years and continues to grow at a steady pace with new products coming out every year that are more powerful than ever before. But there's no denying it — even if they don't have as many customers right now as Apple did when Steve Jobs first took over from Bill Gates back then.","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. If you're a business owner, it's probably best for the company that makes money from its products and services rather than just selling them at retail stores (or even in an online store).","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. In the case of a laptop, it's probably best if your budget has more than one processor and there are no other options available (like an Intel Core i5-2500K).","The answer to this question depends on the type of computer you're using. If your PC has a large number (say, 10 million) and it's running Windows XP with 64-bit support then there are some advantages that come into play when choosing between two different versions for each operating system – namely compatibility across platforms such as Linux/Mac OS X etc. However, if one version runs at least twice what another does in terms ""compatibility"", which means more performance per dollar spent compared against other PCs based on their hardware specifications than they do from software features alone!"

If you want a car that will get you from A to B and back again in comfort, then it makes sense for BMW. But if you want something with more of an edge over its competitors, look at Ford. The company has been making cars since 1908, but they have always had one thing going for them: reliability. They were built by hand using only the best materials, so their vehicles last forever. And while Ford may not be as good as some other automakers, there are still many people who love them. In fact, according to Consumer Reports, “Americans like them better than any brand except Chevrolet.”

 So which model should you buy? Here are my top picks: 
 
 1. 2016 Audi A8 Sportback. This German luxury sedan was designed specifically for Audi’s new sports division, called Vision Mercedes-Benz.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car that’s going to be the fastest and most comfortable, then you’ll probably go with BMW. But if you prefer something more sporty, like Ford or Mercedes, then you’d likely choose Ford. And since both brands are owned by German automakers, it’s not hard to see why. Both companies have been making cars in Germany for decades, so they know how to make great cars. In fact, Mercedes has even won some awards for its performance vehicles. So why would anyone buy an American car? Well, there’s no doubt about it: Americans love their cars, especially SUVs. They also tend to spend less money than people who live outside of America. This means that there will always be demand for American-made vehicles – just look at all those new pickup trucks coming off assembly lines every year. When it comes down to it, though, we can’t really blame Americans. We don’t get as many choices when buying our cars here as other countries.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you consider a better car. The Ford Focus RS and its sister car the Fiesta ST are both great cars in their own right, but they don’t have any of BMW’s luxury features like leather seats, heated seats etc. They also cost significantly more than the Focus. If you’re looking for something with those features, then go ahead and buy one of those. But if your main goal is just getting a good car, then I’d recommend going with either the Focus or Fiesta. Both offer excellent driving dynamics and solid handling characteristics. And while they’re not as fast as some other cars, neither will break down under heavy loads. In my opinion, it’s best to stick with the basic model of each automaker. You can always upgrade later on, when you’ve got enough money saved up. For example, I’ve been using an old Toyota Corolla since it was first introduced back in 2001. It’s still running strong today, so I’m sure I’ll be able to get another couple years out of it.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car that will be driven every day, then the Ford Focus RS might not be right for you. However, if you are more of an enthusiast who likes driving it once in awhile, then you’ll probably like BMW’s new M3. Both cars have been designed with their respective markets in mind. For example, the Focus RS, which has a base price starting at $49,900, comes equipped with features such as heated seats, air conditioning, and leather seats. It also gets about 30 miles per gallon better than its predecessor. While the M3 starts around $52,500, it’s got all those same features, plus some extras including automatic climate control, cruise control and LED headlights. It’s even available with adaptive dampers and anti-lock brakes. In terms of performance, both vehicles get great fuel economy, but they differ significantly when it comes to handling performance.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a car that will last for years, then the Ford Focus RS has got it covered. It can be found in two trim levels – LX and EX-L – which have different engines from 1.6 litre petrol up to 2.0 litre. Both versions of the model come with an automatic transmission. However, if you are more interested in sporty handling, then the Ford Fiesta ST is your best bet. This compact hatchback comes with either a 1.8 or 2.0-liter engine. In addition, there is also a diesel version available as well. The engine choice makes all the difference when choosing between these cars. You should choose one based upon its performance characteristics.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan of the two, then it's probably best for them to be in competition with each other and not compete against one another at all (or even just because they are competing).","The answer to this question depends on how you define ""better."" The word comes from the German verb, meaning ""to be good,"" and it's often used in a way that makes sense. For example if we're talking about an automobile with high performance components like suspension systems (e-tron), power steering system/controls etc., then there are many ways of describing what constitutes best for your car; but even when I say most important things such as handling qualities at all levels – especially those involving braking efficiency - my definition doesn't always match up well enough so far into our understanding because some aspects may not make much difference between cars based solely around these features alone.","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The two companies have had their share of controversies over the years, but they've never really settled on one brand as being more important than another in terms (or even for them) of sales and profits. If you're looking at how much money each company makes from its cars – which are often used by people who don't drive themselves very well - it's hard not see why this would be so difficult when there aren't many other options available outside those categories such an Audi A3 with all-wheel steering; if we were just talking about what kind 'good enough', then I'd say both brands should go out into production together rather quickly because these things can get expensive pretty fast without any sortof competition whatsoever between manufacturers either way!","The answer to that question depends on what you're looking for. The best option, of course (and the one most likely) would be a car with an engine capable of producing more power than any other vehicle in its class and at least as much torque output from it — but if your goal was just getting around town without driving too many cars then this might not work out so well either way. And while there are plenty good options available right now like Honda's V8-powered Civic Hybrid which can produce up close 1kW by 15% over current models such Asperger syndrome has been shown to cause serious health problems including heart disease and stroke, we've yet seen anything quite similar here before.","The answer to that question depends on what you're looking for. The most common choice, according the American Automobile Association (AAC), are both cars and trucks with a high-end performance package like an all new 4Runner engine running at 3200 rpm in either sport mode – which means it's going fast enough so as not take up too much space when driving around town! And if your goal isn't just getting good mileage but also being able drive well over 100 miles per gallon of fuel economy while commuting from one place down another then there may be some other options out here such ""supercharged"" models available including those offered by Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Civic Hybrid, Hyundai Sonata/Honda Fit / Nissan Leaf."

However, honda has pluses too: simpler, faster, speed.","The answer to this question depends on the type of car you drive. If you’re looking for a sporty ride with great handling and excellent fuel economy, then Honda will be your best bet. However, if you’d rather have more power than better handling, then you’ll want BMW. Both cars are very well made, but they both offer different levels of performance in their respective categories. For example, while BMW offers an impressive amount of power, it also has some of the most refined suspension tuning available. This makes its vehicles extremely reliable when compared to other German automakers. On the other hand, Honda provides a much smoother ride, superior fuel economy and even higher top speed thanks to its advanced electronics. In fact, it’s so good that many people prefer driving one over the other. Which Car Is Best: Porsche 911, Audi R8, Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG GT Cabriolet 
 
 While there isn’t really any clear winner between these two cars, we can all agree that they’re pretty close.","The answer to that question depends on what you want from your car. If you’re looking for a car that’s fun and fast, then the Honda Civic Type R will be right up your alley. But if you’d rather have something with more character than speed, then you’ll probably prefer BMW’s new M3. And if you’ve always wanted an SUV but can’t afford one, then maybe it’s time to consider the Audi Q7. All three of these cars are great in their own ways, so we decided to rank them based solely on how they stack up. We also considered factors like price, performance, handling, comfort, and reliability. For each car, we took into account its overall value, as well as its relative strengths and weaknesses. In other words, we looked at all aspects of the car: cost, ride, handling and comfort. These ratings were determined by comparing two different versions of one car against another version of the same vehicle. This means that while some vehicles may look better than others, there isn’t really any objective way to compare them.","The new Honda Civic Si and the new BMW 3 Series Sedan are both great cars. But which one of them will you buy in a few years? We think that it depends on your budget. If you’re looking for something with more power, go for BMW. Otherwise, stick to the Civic. And if you want an affordable car that’s fun to drive, then we recommend buying the Honda Fit EV. It’s not as fast but it’s much cheaper than any other car. You can also find out how many miles you’ll get per gallon by comparing our test results below. How does fuel economy compare between these two cars? Well, let’s start off with fuel. In terms of fuel, the Accord has better mileage than the Civic, at about 18 mpg. However, when you factor in gas costs, the Accord costs less because its engine uses regular unleaded gas. This means that, even though the Civic gets slightly better, overall fuel efficiency isn’t significantly better. For example, the average price of gasoline varies from $1.70 to $2.80 depending where you live.","The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you want a car with the best handling and handling, then Honda will be better for you. But if you’re looking for an all-around sports car, then BMW’s M3, which has been around since 2007, might just be what you’re after. And while both cars are great in their own ways, they have different strengths and weaknesses. Advertisement 
 
 To get a feel for how each one stacks up, we put them through our standard tests using all four models from the same manufacturer. We also took into account things like price, range, fuel economy, driving dynamics, comfort, and comfort. For this test, we used the 2013 model year as a baseline because that’s when most new vehicles go on sale.","The new Honda CBR250R has been on sale for a few months now, and it looks like the bike will be available in North America at some point this year. It was first spotted by our friends over at Motorcycle.com back in January, but now we have confirmation from BMW. According to an email sent out by their US sales department, the CBR250 will go into production sometime next year, with deliveries starting later than originally planned. This means that if you want one of these bikes, you’ll need to wait until 2018. That’s not too bad, considering how long it’s taking us to get them here. But what about price? Well, according to BMW, the price won’t change much. They say they expect the bikes to start around $49,000 when they’re ready to hit dealerships. That seems pretty reasonable given all that’s going on. We don’t know much more other than that, so we’ll just take your word for it.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better"" than the other two. The first, and most important one, comes down in terms of performance (and reliability). If it's a car that has been around for more years now, then there are probably some things about its design which make sense at least as far back into history as we can get away with today.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The two companies have always had their share of controversies, but the fact that they've never really come together in any meaningful way means it's not as if there are no problems with each other at all — and even more so because both brands were founded by people who knew what was best for them when things went wrong (and I'm sure you know how much we love our cars). But now those issues seem like an afterthought on my list; one which should be addressed sooner rather than later anyway!","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. The most common questions that come up when it comes down the road in terms of a car's performance and reliability, however there may be some other factors as well (like how much power your engine produces). For example if an electric motor has more torque than gasoline engines can produce at higher speeds they will have less horsepower which means fewer miles driven per gallon compared with diesel cars but also lower fuel economy due not only to their smaller size so no need having all those extra pounds!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. For example, if you are a fan who likes the idea that there will be more cars in production and want something different from what we have now (and maybe even less), then it might make sense for us not only as fans but also consumers too. But how do people feel about these new models being offered at all prices when they can get them free with their own car insurance policy without having to pay any extra money upfront – which would certainly help reduce costs by reducing sales tax rates!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're looking for a car that's more affordable, then the best option would be either an all-wheel drive model with 3D wheels and ABS (or both), as well in terms about how much it costs compared against other options like Ford Focus models which cost less than $200k but have higher fuel economy ratings such Asperger syndrome/high blood pressure etc., while also offering some features similar enough not only do they offer lower emissions levels when driving at high speeds without any side effects from them though there are no safety issues associated with using these cars because their engine can run out before hitting anything else so if those things don't work just buy one instead!"
57,Dell,Hewlett-Packard,"""While Dell remains the world's biggest PC maker, it has been losing market share to Hewlett-Packard and others.
At the same time, Dell is struggling to regain market share from its rival Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest computer maker.
In the slowing PC market, Dell lost share during the first calendar quarter of the year to rivals like Hewlett-Packard.","In the U.S., Hewlett-Packard held the most market share followed by Dell, Apple, Lenovo, and Toshiba.
Hewlett-Packard led the market with an 18.8% share, followed by Dell, 13.9%; Acer, 12.2%; Lenovo, 7.5%; and Toshiba, 4.6%.

Dell is coming into the blade-server market later than competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer .Competitors Scrambling Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) is losing share of back-office systems to commodity-maker Dell (NASDAQ: DELL ) and has reported earnings reductions exceeding 30% .Apple scored 10 points higher than Dell, 12 points higher than Hewlett-Packard, and 13 points higher than Gateway.Dell still gets a bigger chunk of total revenue from PCs and laptops than its main rival, Hewlett Packard Co.

(HPQ) in the longer term.""Hewlett-Packard is growing faster than Dell right now for the first time in four years.Hewlett-Packard, which sells a much wider range of products than Dell, was hurt twice by the decline in the PC market.","Taking into account the benefits of dell (market, share, higher), it is better. However, hewlett-packard is not be ignored, because it is: longer, faster, wider.","The HP Pavilion dv7 laptop has a very nice screen, but the keyboard and mouse are not as good as those on my old Compaq Presario laptop. I also have an older Sony Vaio with Windows XP that runs much faster than this one. This computer does run faster, however, it seems to be more of a battery hog because when you turn off your computer, sometimes it takes several minutes for it to boot up again. It doesn't seem like it's going to last long if I'm using it all day every day. My other complaint about this machine is its weight. It's heavier than any previous model I've owned, including the original IBM ThinkPad. When you're holding it, you feel it. And that's just from looking at it! You can tell by touching it that there's something in there.","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you’re a business user who needs the best performance and features for your business, then HP may be better than Dell. But if you’re just using it as an everyday computer with some light gaming, then it’s hard to beat Dell’s XPS 13 9360. It’s also worth noting that this laptop has been updated since its launch in October 2017. It now comes equipped with Intel® Iris Plus graphics, which means you’ll get more speed out of every game. And because Intel integrated graphics aren’t limited by CPU speed, they can run games at higher resolutions without having to worry about framerate issues. This makes gaming even better. Buying Options 
 
 You don’t have to choose between these two laptops. Both offer great specs but different features. For example, the X1 Yoga 13S offers up a faster processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD storage, while the Spectre x360 15 includes both those upgrades along with a 4K display and optional Touch Bar.","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a laptop with the same battery life as your desktop, then HP and Dell laptops will be better for you. But if you need something more portable, look at Lenovo. And if you don’t mind paying more, go ahead and buy an Apple laptop. You won’t regret it. There are two main reasons why people prefer Dell: they have great customer service and, most importantly, their products tend not to break down after several years of use. This means that, even though it might cost more than other brands, you’ll get much longer use out of them. Another reason why many customers choose Dell over others is because of its reliability. They may also like how easy it is to upgrade components. In fact, this has been one of the biggest complaints about Windows 8 – it’s too hard to upgrade. However, there are some good news stories from Dell, such as when it was discovered that upgrading components in older computers could actually improve performance.","The HP Pavilion dv6 has a beautiful screen and the keyboard feels very good. I have no problems with it. However, it does not come with any software for Windows 7. It only comes with Office 2007 Starter Edition. This means that you cannot install Microsoft Office. You can use this computer to run Word, Excel and Powerpoint. But if you want to do anything else, such as play games, watch videos, listen music etc. then you will need another computer. If you are looking for something more powerful, go ahead and buy an iMac. They offer much better performance than HP. For example, they also provide dual core processors which makes them faster when doing some of these things. Also, Apple offers many different types of computers so you should be able to find one that suits your needs. A few years ago, my wife bought me a new laptop from Dell. She had been using her old Compaq Presario CQ60 since 2004. That was back in the days before laptops were even popular.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you want from a computer. If you’re looking for something that’s going to be your primary computer, then HP and Dell are probably better choices. But if you’re more of an entertainment device, like me, then Apple will do just fine. The MacBook Air has been my favorite laptop since it was first released. It feels great in the hand, it’s fast, easy to use, and looks great. It’s also got some really cool features like AirPlay 2 mirroring so you can stream movies wirelessly over Wi-Fi. And while Apple’s new Mac Pro might not have all those features, its performance makes up for it. So which one should you buy? Well, there aren’t many choices out there. You could go with either Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Sony, Toshiba, Acer, or Apple. All these companies make laptops that look great, feel good in the hands, perform well, and cost less than $500. That means they don’t need to offer any special features.","The answer to this question depends on which company you're talking about. The best choice for a laptop, and the one that's most likely to be your primary workstation of any kind, will probably have an Intel Core i7 processor with 2GB RAM (or more) running at 4GHz in order not only to run well but also provide excellent performance when it comes time to boot up from USB 3.0 ports like Windows 7 Pro/8 if needed; however, there are other options available as far back as 2008 where AMD has been offering their own processors based on its latest chipsets such Asetek X370 series instead. In fact, many people who've used these laptops say they'd rather use either HP Chromebooks than Microsoft Surface tablets because both offer similar hardware specs compared against each others' offerings so long ago – even though those devices were designed specifically around them by IBM before being sold commercially through various retailers including Amazon UK.","The answer to that question depends on what you're looking for. The best choice, of course, lies in the HP Pavilion 7 and 8 (both with a single processor), but there are many other options available from both companies as well. For instance we've seen some very good laptops at price points ranging from $200-$300 depending upon which one's used it most recently – so if your budget isn't quite where I'd recommend buying this laptop over any others then consider checking out our review here.","The answer to that question depends on your point of view. The best way to determine which one you prefer, and what's more important than the other two options (and I'm not going into it here), are by looking at how much money each company makes in its own products — a number called ""product sales."" These numbers can be used as an indicator of where companies stand relative now with respect for their product lines but don't necessarily reflect any change over time; they're just estimates based upon market trends rather then actual results from individual customers who buy different versions of those same devices every year so there isn'a lot riding around when we say this about HP vs Apple versus Microsoft/Google etc. So if our data shows us Lenovo has made $1 billion less per quarter since 2007 compared against Intel ($2.5 billion) while AMD had only been making between 1.6% & 2%.","The answer to this question depends on the company. If you're a big business, it's probably best that your customers buy from HP and not Lenovo (or any other major manufacturer). But if you want something more affordable for small businesses like yours — which are often struggling with low margins in their products – then there are many alternatives available at cheaper prices than what we've seen so far here today. And while some of these options may seem expensive compared against others, they can be very effective when combined with an existing product line such as Windows 10 Mobile OS X Lion Edition.","The answer to this question depends on the company. The best way to determine which one you prefer would be by comparing your own personal computer with a competitor's, but it doesn't have to do that for every single product in our list of Best Buy Computers (and if there are any other products we don' t know about). We've included some information from HP and IBM as well so they can help us decide what makes them stand out among their competitors when choosing between these two brands over competing ones like Lenovo/Lenovo ThinkPad XPS 13X / Yoga Pad 10x. If all else fails, then let me tell ya...the difference here isn\'t even close."

 or Intel? The answer depends on what you are looking for. If you want a good processor for the money, then go with an Intel processor. But if you need something that can handle more than just basic computing tasks, and have some power to spare, then look at the AMD processors. They offer great performance in both price range and performance. And they also come with better cooling solutions as well. For example, the Athlon 64 X2 4200+ offers up to 3.2GHz of base clock speed, while the Phenom II X4 955 has only 1.3GHz. This means that even though it costs more, the AMD processors will give you much higher performance, which makes them worth it. You may not be able to get all four cores working at their full potential, but this should still provide enough speed for most users. Another thing about these processors, besides price, is how well they perform. I would say that the best way to judge whether your computer meets or exceeds its specifications is by running benchmarks.","Links What is better: IBM

 Great processor!I've been using a Core i7 920 with an SSD drive in it since 2009 when they first came out. It still runs great but it's time to upgrade so I decided to go Intel instead of AMD because I'm running Windows 8 Pro 64 bit and have no issues at all with it. It's fast, quiet, cool, and stable. My old system would run games like Skyrim at high settings without any problems whatsoever. Now I can play them smoothly even though they're much more demanding than before. If you're looking for a good CPU that's fast enough to handle most modern games, you can't do better than this.","Links What is better: IBM
 or Intel? I think the answer to that question depends on what you want from your computer. If you're looking for a computer with great battery life, this one might be better than an i5 but not by much. But if you just need something reliable and fast, then Intel has been doing it right since its inception. And when it comes to performance, it's hard to beat Intel's Core 2 Duo processor. The new Haswell processors are even better, especially in terms of performance. This laptop also supports up to 16GB DDR3 memory which means you'll have plenty of room to run Windows 7 64-bit without having to upgrade anytime soon. It runs cool enough at idle so you can leave it plugged into AC power all day long while still getting good performance out of it. It's got two USB 3.0 ports as well, making it easy to connect external storage devices like flash drives or portable drives. There's no optical drive though, only a full-size SD card slot. You won't find any HDMI port either.","Links What is better: IBM
 or Intel? The answer depends on what you are looking for. If you want to run a full fledged OS like Windows 7 then go with the Intel NUC. But if you just need something that can play games and do basic computing tasks this will be more than enough. It has an i3 processor which means it runs at 3.2GHz, but most people don't even notice it. I have never seen any lag when playing games. This computer also comes with 4GB of RAM. Most laptops only come with 1GB. So for those who aren't concerned about RAM size there should not be much difference in price. For some reason they seem to charge double for memory these days. You could always upgrade your ram later on. As far as graphics go, this laptop does pretty well. It's got two HDMI ports, one DVI, one VGA port, headphone jack, webcam and microphone. There isn't really anything else to say here. All in all it's a great laptop.","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a computer with the best performance for your money, then Intel will probably be better than AMD. But if you just need something fast, and don't care about all of its other features, then AMD might be better. And even though it has been around longer than Intel's current offerings, it's still not as good at gaming as Nvidia's latest offerings. So which one do I pick? Well, in my opinion, there really isn't any clear winner. Both companies have their strengths and weaknesses, but they both offer great value for money. In fact, when comparing them against each other, we can see how much more powerful Nvidia is. For example, let's look at some benchmarks from our own review of the GTX 1070. We tested this card using 3DMark06, an open source benchmark program developed by NVIDIA. This test measures graphics processing power (GPU) per clock cycle.","What is better: IBM
 or Intel? The answer to this question depends on your perspective. For example, if you're a computer scientist and want to know how the world works (and what's going wrong with it), then I'd say that Apple has been good at making things work for them since its inception in 1984; but they've also made some pretty bad decisions over time as well. In fact there are many reasons why Microsoft might not have done so much more than just make Windows 10 faster — like their own proprietary operating system was too slow when running Linux back before release of OS X Mavericks 2. But those problems were largely solved by moving away from using third-party software such Assembler, which makes building applications easier while still keeping everything up to date across all platforms including iOS 7 & 8 ; instead we use an open source tool called OpenCL/OpenSSL built into every platform supported today : http://www2ndclouds.com/.","What is better: IBM
 or Intel? The answer to this question depends on which one you ask. I'm not sure what the best-known name for a computer comes from, but it's probably ""Intel."" It has been around since at least 1980 and was designed by John McAfee in 1984 (and later replaced with Hewlett Packard) before being discontinued as part of HP Enterprise Computing Systems back then. In fact there are many other names that have come up over the years including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corp., Apple Incorporated, Motorola Mobility Ltd. etc... But if we look closely enough our list goes like so;

But it's clear from our research and analysis, both in terms (1) how they are perceived by consumers; as a company with an established reputation for innovation but also because their products have been around since at least 2007—and even more recently due largely through acquisitions such Asilomar Systems' Advanced Micro Devices division which was acquired last year after its acquisition of Hewlett-Packard).","What is better: IBM

If the two companies are competing for a share of computing power, then they should be in competition with each other and not compete against one another (or even more closely). But if both have similar operating systems running Linux-based platforms like Windows 10, it's possible there could be some sort ""competition"" between them — especially since Microsoft has been trying hard lately to get its own OS onto PCs as well. It would also make sense from a business perspective because most people don't know what their PC will look exactly when using an open source system such Asperger syndrome software called OpenCL/OpenGL."

It also came equipped entirely with two front seats for those who wanted something different; one seat would be reserved exclusively between drivers while another could sit next door if they wished. This meant there were no driver controls when driving either cars – you'd have to stand up straight away so your head wouldn't fall off during acceleration but still get out into traffic without having to turn around once again!

One way would be to compare apples and oranges. Let’s say we have three chips — one from each company — and let’s assume they all perform equally well. Then we’d want to see how well they do when they’re pitted against each other. To get there, we’ll need some kind of objective measure of performance. That is, we could just take our best chip out of the bunch and put them head-to-head against their other chips.

So here’s my test case: I’m going to use Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080, which was released last year.","The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” Intel’s latest processors are more powerful than ever, but they also cost a lot more. Google has been making inroads into the smartphone market with its Nexus line, which includes phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P, as well as tablets such as the Pixel C and Pixel. But it still lags behind Apple in terms of raw processing power, so it’s not clear how much better these chips will be compared to their rivals. In any case, both companies have made strides over the past few years toward improving performance for mobile devices. And while Apple’s new iPhone 7 Plus may look better, there’s no denying that Android devices run faster and smoother than ever. If you’re looking at buying an iPhone, though, you’ll probably want something that’s going to last longer — especially if your job involves lots of multitasking.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is speed and power, then the choice between Intel and Google will be easy. But if you want a more powerful processor with better battery life, look at Intel. And for those who care about security, consider choosing an AMD processor. In our testing, we found that both processors were fast enough for most tasks but not quite as good as their competitors. For example, in some tests, the Core i5-8250U was faster than the Core i7-8750U, which has four cores instead of two. This difference may have been due to the fact that the two chips share the same L3 cache size. However, it could also reflect differences in power consumption — the i5 uses less energy when idle compared to its larger brother. We tested each chip against three other processors, including AMD’s own Ryzen 7 1800X, Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845. All tests used Geekbench 4 synthetic benchmarks.","The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you are a Google fan and want the best possible experience for all things Google, then I would say go with Intel. But if you’re more concerned about security, stability and performance, then I’d recommend going with Google. You get what you pay for. In any case, it’s clear from these results that both companies have made some great strides in their respective areas over the past few years. And while it may not be as exciting as seeing an Apple laptop running Windows 10, we can see how far they have come. About Author

If you want a fast and powerful computer that can do everything from running Photoshop to playing video games at high settings, then the Google Chromebook Pixel would be your best bet. However, if you just need something for basic web browsing, email and word processing, then it might not be worth it. For those who have more demanding needs, such as gaming, photography, music production and more, they should consider an Apple MacBook Air. It has all of these features plus more. And it’s much cheaper than its competitors. In conclusion, we hope that our guide will help you make up your mind which laptop is right for you.

 Joshua S. Hill - I'm a tech junkie with a love for anything tech. I write about new gadgets, software, online services, social media and gaming.","The answer to that question may surprise you. The two companies are not the only ones who have been making money off of Android phones and tablets, but they're also among those most likely to be getting a lot more from their products than Apple's iPhone has gotten out there in terms (and even if it does get cheaper). And while some people might think this isn't going anywhere anytime soon, I'm sure many will still find themselves wondering what exactly Microsoft was doing with its Windows Phone 8 operating system when all these rumors started flying around back then! That said…I don' t know about anyone else on earth having any idea how much Samsung made selling smartphones at $199/£249 for an OS like iOS 7+ would cost them; maybe we'll just see another year where Nokia sells iPhones as well?","The answer to this question has been a resounding yes. The two companies have long had strong ties with each other, and the fact that they are both in business makes it easy for them to get along without any conflict of interest issues at all (even if some may disagree). But there's also an important difference between what you see on TV shows like ""Breaking Bad"" — which deals with corporate malfeasance rather than corruption as much more often happens when people work together instead—and how things look from their side.","I'm not sure. I've been using the same laptop for a while now, and it's always great to have an alternative that works on both platforms at once (and with different hardware).","The answer to this question has always been, ""I don't know."" But as we've seen with the recent announcement of a new Nexus 7 tablet and its rumored successor in 2018 (the company's own Pixel), it seems like there are some things that can be done about Android. The first thing you need for your device should not be an OS-based one; rather than simply having something built into every app on any platform—like iOS does now —you'll want to have apps running natively within each application layer from which they're derived by default when using them together. This means if all applications run at once without needing separate libraries such code may well work fine but will require more complex dependencies between different layers depending upon how much time passes before those components start working properly across multiple devices simultaneously!","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had strong ties with the military, and they are both well-known for their support of Israel's security. But in recent years there was an increasing number who felt that it would be difficult if Israeli forces were not allowed into Palestinian territory (and thus could use force against them). This led many Israelis to believe that such restrictions should only apply to those countries which did allow UAVs on land; however, since these nations do provide some form at least as much protection from attack by drones than any other country does—the United States alone provides about 1%–2%. In fact, even though drone attacks can sometimes result in civilian casualties due simply because civilians may run away rather quickly after being hit, most people still feel strongly enough toward American involvement when faced up close."

 An Iraqi man holds his weapon as he stands next to an ISIS flag in Tikrit on Sunday.","The answer to this question depends on what you consider a “better” shoe. If you’re looking for the best performance and comfort, then Adidas will be your choice. However, if you’re more concerned with style than performance, Nike may offer better value at lower prices. Choosing between these two brands can make all of the difference in how long you’ll wear them. For example, I have been wearing Nike’s Air Max 1 since they first came out back in 2007. They are still my favorite running shoe, but now that I’ve tried some other shoes from Nike, I’m finding them less comfortable. In fact, after doing some research online, it seems like most people who buy new pairs of Nike shoes end up switching brands. So it’s important to find a shoe that’s comfortable enough so that you don’t feel as though you’ve lost any significant amount of performance. But not too uncomfortable where you can’t run anymore. Conclusion 
 
 When choosing shoes, there are many factors to consider. You should look into which brand offers the highest quality materials and construction, while also offering an affordable price.","Adidas has been the official supplier of basketball shoes for more than a century. The company was founded in Germany and now operates worldwide. It also makes athletic wear, including sneakers that are popular with athletes. But it does not make shoes. Instead, its products are sold by other companies, like Under Armour. In recent years, however, Adidas has become increasingly involved in basketball, particularly as part of an effort to expand into China. Last year, it signed deals worth $350 million over five years with Chinese companies — among them the country’s most successful team, Shanghai Sharks, which will play at Madison Square Garden next season.

 “They’re very good at what they do,” said Brian Windhorst, who runs the global sports business consulting firm Sportscorp. “They have great brands across all sports. They know how to build brands.","I have a feeling that the answer to this question will be different for each of us. For me, it was Adidas because they are my favorite brand and their products always fit me well. But if you want to know more about Nike, then read on below. The first thing we need to do when choosing our shoes is find out what type of shoe your feet need. If you’re looking at buying new shoes, make sure they’re comfortable enough so you’ll walk around in them all day. You can also check how well cushioning works with other shoes. When shopping online, look for brands like Asics, New Balance, Saucony, etc. These companies offer great deals on running shoes too. Once you’ve found some good brands, it’s time to start shopping. There are many types of running shoes available today. Some people prefer minimalist shoes; others run marathons in them. Whatever style you choose, choose one that’s made specifically for running. They should feel light but supportive, while still being able to provide support during long runs.","The answer to this question depends on what you consider a “better” shoe. If you’re looking for the best shoe that will last longer and provide better support, then Adidas has been around since the beginning of time. They have always made quality shoes at affordable prices. However, if you’re more interested in style than comfort, then Nike might be your new favorite choice. Their lightweight design makes them ideal for running and other activities. You can even wear these sneakers while playing sports. These are some of the most popular styles right now. As far as price goes, they range from $45 – $50. For those who want something with a little bit more style, there are also several brands like Puma and Reebok. In terms of durability, however, it’s hard to beat Nike. They make high-quality products that stand up well over time without losing their shape. This means that you’ll get years out of them. Conclusion 
 
 When it comes down to it, we all know that buying cheap isn’t necessarily better.","The answer to this question has been a resounding yes. The two brands have always had their share of controversy, but the fact that they are both brand ambassadors for one another and in many ways represent each other makes them an ideal choice as well. It's no surprise then that these companies would be very happy with either pair if it were possible (as long ago there was only ONE shoe on sale). But what about those who don't want something different from any previous generation sports shoes like Air Jordan 1s/2s etc? Well let's look at some examples!","The answer to this question may be a little more complicated than you might think. The two companies have different philosophies on how they want their athletes, and the results of those decisions can vary greatly from one brand to another.","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had their share of controversy, but they've always maintained the same basic philosophy. In fact it's probably best for them not only to be more competitive with each other in terms (and thus less likely) than competitors do; rather, this will allow both brands and athletes to compete on an equal footing against one another without having any significant differences between themselves as far back into history as possible—a concept which would make sense if you were trying out different styles at once instead! So what does all these changes mean when we look at how much competition exists among sports teams today comparedto those who are competing under similar brand names like Team USA? Well first off, there isn't really anything wrong with being able take advantage from your own team-mates' strengths while still maintaining some semblance about yourself within its ranks… especially since most people don 'like'.","The answer to that question will be found in the following video. It's a great way of showing you how much more comfortable and stylish your shoes are, but it also shows what kind people think about them (and their choices). The first thing I did was look at my own personal opinion on whether they were good for me personally…I'm not sure if there really exists one right now!","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" The two companies have long had an affinity for the sport of basketball, and both are known for their commitment."

However, siemens has pluses too: greater, bigger, higher.","The Nokia Lumia 920 has been a great phone for me. I have had it since the day of its release and am still using it. It was my first Windows Phone device, but after getting used to it, I’ve found that it’s actually quite easy to use. It’s not as fast as an iPhone, but that’s because I’m on Verizon Wireless. My only complaint about this device would be the battery life. If you use your phone heavily, you’ll need to charge it every day. But if you’re like me, who uses their phones lightly, then you’ll probably never run out of juice. And even with heavy use, you can easily get through one full day without having to charge. That’s pretty impressive. Overall, I’d say the Nokia Lumia 920’s performance is very good. However, there are some things that could make me switch from Nokia to Microsoft. For one, Microsoft doesn’t offer any apps in the Play Store. This means that most people will either go back to iOS or Android when they want to do something more than just browse the web.","The Nokia N900 was a great phone and it had some very nice features. It also has the best camera of any mobile phone. However, I think that the Nokia N800 will be even better. This time around, they are going to focus on making this device more user friendly. They have already added many new features such as an improved browser, better battery life, and more. There are still several bugs in the software but these can easily be fixed with updates. If you want to know what else about the phone, read on. Hardware Specifications 
 
 The hardware specifications for the Nokia N800 are pretty impressive. First off, we get two cameras which take pictures at full resolution (16:9) and 1080p video. One thing that really impressed me was how fast the phones were able to process pictures. In my tests, I saw no lag when taking photos while using both cameras. Another feature that surprised me was the fact that there is not one single button on the device. Instead, each function requires only pressing three different buttons.","I think Nokia has a better chance of winning the smartphone market than Siemens. The reason for this is that Nokia will have to compete with Android and iOS in order to keep its users happy. It seems like they are doing pretty well so far. If you look at their numbers, it looks as if they sold more phones last quarter than any other phone maker. They also had one of the highest profit margins on smartphones last quarter. This means that they can afford to make some changes without having to raise prices. For example, they could lower prices by lowering the price of the phone. Or they might even offer an upgrade program where people would be able to buy new devices every year instead of buying them outright. These kinds of things would help boost sales while keeping customers loyal. However, there are still many hurdles ahead before these companies become successful. One thing that worries me about both companies is how long it takes for them to gain enough traction to really take off. In fact, it’s not clear whether either company can ever achieve mass adoption.","The Nokia N900 was a great phone and I loved it. It had all the features of my old Motorola RAZR V3 plus it came with an FM radio which worked great. But then they decided to make this new version called the N900. And what happened? They removed some of the cool features. For example, you can no longer use your own MP3 player as a music player. You have to buy one from them. Also, when using WiFi on it, if you're in 3G mode (which means that it's connected to WiFi) the battery life goes down dramatically. So now I'm stuck buying another phone. If only there were something like Android phones where we could just download apps instead of having to pay for them through our carrier. I think people are getting tired of paying hundreds of dollars every year for cell phones. It's not worth it. There should be more competition out there. This isn't even about making money. It's about giving consumers choices. That's why Apple has been so successful. People want choice. Why can't companies do that?","I think the Nokia N900 was a great phone and it had some really nice features. The camera on this device is not as good but it’s still better than most other phones out there. If you want to get an Android phone, then go with Samsung Galaxy S3. It has more features that are useful for me. Do you have any favorite apps from your phone? There isn’t many apps in my phone. But there are plenty of games which can be played without using data plan. And if you don’t like games, there’s always YouTube. How do you feel about Windows Phone 8?http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/02/08/133563474/obama-to-announce-new-nuclear-strategy-on-feb-11 
 Obama To Announce New Nuclear Strategy On Feb. 11 : The Two-WayPresident Barack Obama's new strategy will include plans to reduce U.S. nuclear stockpiles by up to 1,550 warheads over 10 years.","The answer to this question can be found in the following chart. The first two are from a recent report by Bloomberg, which shows that Microsoft's Lumia line has been growing at an average rate of 2% per year for three years now and it looks like they're on track to do so again next quarter (see below).","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had their share of controversies, but the fact remains that they are both very different. Both were founded by former military officers who came together in 1968 and became one company after another with an eye toward building on what was already established as America's first wireless network – namely its ability for people around them (and even those outside) accessable via cell phones at any time during day-to--day life. In short order, neither could offer anything resembling security without being able either to provide it directly from afar through phone calls made over cellular networks; nor did anyone else do so until much later when Google began offering voice calling services under license agreements similar only slightly more expensively than other carriers' offerings such Ascent service providers like Verizon Wireless.","The answer to this question depends on your perspective. The two companies are both very different in their approach and the fact that they have been around for a long time makes them unique, but it's not as if you can't see what works best with each other (or vice versa).","The answer to that question depends on how you look at it. The company has a long history of making smart phones, and its latest flagship smartphone was the first in line for this category (the Lumia 920). It's also one with an impressive range — if not more so than any other phone out there today – but as we've seen before from Samsung, they're still struggling against Apple when compared by market share per unit sales over time. That said though, I think these are two very different things; both have their strengths here too. One thing about them being able do something like what Huawei did last year without having much competition around each others' products isn't really surprising given all those years spent building up Android devices which were just great enough even while competing well behind Google/Apple hardware offerings such Aspire Pro 3D glasses etc. So let me give some background information…

 ""Huawei"" means 'Halo', meaning Microsoft made Halo games based off Windows Phone 8.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. The two companies have been in the same position for a long time, and are still competing with each other at every level — from manufacturing technology (and software) to business development/marketing services (which they both use). It's hard not think about how much more important it is that you're an entrepreneur than what comes after being part-time CEO; if there was ever any doubt as far as who would be best suited to take over one day out job when all else fails, then we'd probably agree Microsoft has done their homework right now by taking its next step toward becoming even bigger players within tech industry rather quickly compared ToS."

If so, then HP and Intel are better than HP. But if you want to play with all kinds of fancy features, like virtual memory, 3D graphics, and so on, then go for Intel. And even though these companies have been around since long before Windows was invented, they still offer more features today than most people would ever need. So which one do I choose? In order to make my decision, I looked at three key factors: price, performance, and features. These factors were weighted equally across both systems. Here’s what I came up with: 
 
 Price – This factor is very important when it comes to buying an operating system. You should be able to buy any PC from anywhere without having to pay too much. A good example of this, according to our research, is Microsoft’s Office suite.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a software developer, then the choice between HP and Intel will be easy. But if you want to build an operating system for computers that run Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS, etc. then it becomes very difficult because there isn’t much choice. You have either one of them. And even if they both exist, it’s not clear which one would win in terms of market share. In fact, I think it might make more sense to go with HP. They offer great hardware at reasonable prices. Their products tend to last longer than those from other vendors. And, most importantly, their support team has been really good about helping me get my computer up and running again. There was no way I could afford to buy another computer. So when I got back home, I decided to take advantage of HP’s generous return policy by buying a new one. This time, however, I bought directly through HP, so I didn’t need any kind of extended warranty.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a fan of the old HP and Intel machines, then I guess it would be better for you. But if you prefer new technology, like Windows 8 or Chromebooks, then there really isn’t much difference. In fact, in some cases they might even have more features. For example, both companies offer touch-screen computers with touch screens that can run applications from other devices. This means that users don’t need to use mouse anymore. And these devices also come at lower prices. However, if you want something different than what is offered by either company, then you should definitely consider buying an Apple computer. They are not only cheaper but their products are always up-to-date and feature many useful features such as Touch ID fingerprint scanner. You will find them very easy to use. Moreover, Apple has been known to release updates quickly so you won’t miss any important updates. Finally, most importantly, Apple offers free upgrades every year which makes upgrading your computer easy.","The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you are a fan of the old IBM PC and want it back, then HP may be for you. But if you’re looking at an all-in-one with Windows 8 (or something like it), then Intel will probably do just fine. And while I don’t think it’s fair to compare these two companies, they share some similarities. Both have been around since before Microsoft was even born. They both make computers in large quantities. And, most importantly, both companies can afford to buy up other companies. In fact, as we saw earlier this year, Dell bought EMC. So why can’t HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer, Asus, Toshiba, Samsung, etc. all get together and form one? Well, because there isn’t one. There never has been. That doesn’t mean that there’s no chance for such a thing. It does mean, however, that the chances are slim. For one, the market for PCs hasn’t changed much over the past few years.","The answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better.” If you’re looking for a computer with the best specs and performance, then HP has got your back. But if you’re more concerned about how well it can run Windows 8 than whether it’s fast, you’ll want an Intel processor. And while both companies are still in their infancy, they have already made some big strides toward making computers better at running Windows. In fact, there’s no reason why anyone should buy any other brand of PC right now. It’s not just that they’re faster, but also cheaper — especially when factoring in rebates from retailers. You could spend as much as $1,200 less per machine over two years buying one of these new machines instead of spending $1,600 more. That’s because most PCs sold today come equipped with processors built specifically for Windows, which means they’ll be able to handle all kinds of software without having to worry about compatibility issues down the road. That makes them far easier to upgrade later on.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had strong relationships with the government, and they've worked together for decades.","The answer to that question depends on the company. The two companies are both big players in data analytics and cloud computing, but they have different business models for their services — one focused on enterprise customers while the other focuses on large scale businesses like healthcare providers who want a more flexible approach with less overhead (e2fs). And as we've seen from previous posts about HP's Cloud Computing offerings over at Gartner, there has been some debate among analysts whether these new products will be able meet all of those needs without sacrificing performance either way. But it seems clear this year was no exception; Microsoft announced its first ever Windows 10 Enterprise Edition last week.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The most important difference between the two companies, however — and I'm sure many of us will agree with that statement in a future post—is their pricing.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""no."" The two companies have long had strong ties with the U.S., and both are now in business together, but they've never really shared much about their products as far back as 2008 when HP bought IBM for $1 billion (the company was founded by Steve Jobs). Both of these firms were heavily involved on issues such that Apple's CEO Tim Cook famously said he wanted them to be partners instead. [2] But while there may not always seem like an obvious connection between one technology firm and another—Apple did invest billions into its own computer chip manufacturing process at some point during WWDC last year,[3][4],[5]) it seems unlikely either would ever share any information regarding what those investments might mean today if you ask me personally; I'm sure many people will find out soon enough whether we're talking more than just hardware patents versus software development partnerships rather!","The answer to this question depends on which company you're talking about. You can't just say that HP and IBM are the best, but they both have their own strengths in terms of performance (and cost)."

However, if you’re looking for a budget friendly motherboard that’s not too expensive yet still offers some decent features then look no further. You can always add on extra components later on.

 Great review as always. Thanks for taking time out to write it. I'm going to buy one soon so I'll know how well it's done in the long run. It looks like you're getting better reviews than most people seem to. One thing I'd love to see from ASUS would be a BIOS update which allows users to disable the onboard graphics card when using Windows 10. This way we could use our own GPU without having to worry about crashing Windows.","I am not a gamer, but i do play some games like CS:GO and TF2. The performance of the GTX 1080 Ti is amazing. It can handle all my games, even when they are very demanding on it. My only complaint about this card would be that it does get hot under load. But for most people who will never use their PC to game at max settings, then you should have no problem with this. If your computer gets too hot, just turn down the fan speed until its cool again. This also applies if you want to overclock. Just make sure you keep an eye out for overheating issues. You may need to replace the GPU in order to prevent damage from over heating. Did you find this review helpful?Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided! Pros: 
 -Runs everything I've thrown at it-Great Price-Looks great-Very quiet-No problems so far 
 
 Cons: 
 None yet 
 
 Other Thoughts: 
 So far, I'm loving it!","I am a bit confused by the fact that you are saying that this card will be able to play games at 1080p with high settings and yet it has no HDMI port. Is there any reason why they would not include one in it? If so, why? Also, what about Crossfire? Will it work as well on my system? Thanks for your help. This is an awesome card, but if you're looking for something more than just gaming then I'd suggest getting a GTX 1070. The 1070 Ti isn't even out yet, so it's hard to get a good deal right now. But if you've got some extra cash lying around and want to upgrade from a 1080 ti then go ahead and grab this. It's definitely worth it. Did you find this review helpful?Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!","I have a question about the new Intel SSD 840 Pro Series and how it compares to other SSDs in terms of performance. The performance numbers are as follows: 
 
 Samsung 830 series (480 GB): ~100 MB/s read / write 
 
 Crucial M4 256 GB (~150 GB): ~ 200 MB/s read / write. Kingston HyperX 3K 240 GB (~250 GB): ~ 300 MB/s. So there you go. For comparison, my old Corsair Force GT 240gb has been running at around 320 MB/s for years now. But that was with an older SATA II interface. My current system uses USB 3 so this should be much faster. Is it worth it? Score: 6 
 
 Title: [Build Complete] First build, first time building a PC from scratch. Thanks /r/buildapc! Text: This is my first build ever, but I've done quite a bit of research on what I'm looking for. It will primarily be used for gaming and general web browsing.","I am a big fan of ASUS motherboards and have been using them for years. They are very reliable and provide great support to their customers. The only thing that bothers me about the GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 motherboard from MSI is its price. It seems like it should be priced at around $300. However, if you can get this board on sale then it’s definitely worth it. If you’re looking for an affordable gaming PC with lots of features but don’t want to spend too much money, look no further. This was my first build so I’m still learning how everything works. But as far as performance goes, I’ve had absolutely zero issues since installing Windows 10 last week. My games run smoothly without any frame drops even when playing multiple games. In fact, most modern AAA titles seem to work perfectly fine in Ultra settings while running other titles. For example, Battlefield 1 runs beautifully at 1080p resolution with all graphics options maxed out. You will need some extra power supply cables though because there isn’t enough room inside your case for everything.","The answer to this question depends on your budget. If you're looking for a solid, affordable laptop that's capable of running Windows 10 and 8 but not having the bells-and‑ whistles like its predecessor (or even worse), then it might be worth considering one with an Intel Core i7 processor instead as well. The company has also released some new laptops in recent years including their latest flagship model which features dual cores from AMD while offering more performance than previous models such Aspire One X3 Pro 3GB RAM ($699).","The answer to this question depends on your specific needs. If you're looking for a laptop that's capable of running Windows 8, then the best option would be either an Intel Core i5-2500K with 4GB RAM and 512MB/s SSD (or both) as well; if not, there are plenty more options available in other markets like China where it can run at least 1TB hard drive instead!","The answer to this question depends on your budget. If you're looking for a laptop that's capable of running Windows 10, then the best option would be either an Intel Core i7-4790K CPU with 4GB RAM and 16 GB storage (or both). The same goes if it comes from another manufacturer like Lenovo which will have more than enough memory capacity in its system space but not too much power consumption as well.","The answer to this question depends on your budget. For the most part, you can get a decent motherboard with good performance and low power consumption for less than $200 (or more if it's an unlocked model).","The answer to this question depends on which brand you're talking about. The two companies are both known for their high-end laptops, and the ASUS ROG Strix has a similar design philosophy as well. However it's not clear if they have any specific plans in mind when choosing between them (or even whether there will be an option)."

Yet, sigma should also be noticed for it is: larger, smoother, faster.","I have a Nikon D800 and it has been my camera for about 2 years now. It was the first digital SLR that I bought when they came out in 2004. The pictures are amazing but there were some things that bothered me with it. For example, if you use flash at all then your picture will be overexposed. If you shoot without flash, even on Auto mode, your photos will come out fine. But if you don't use any flash/no flash, then your images will look like crap because of this. And this problem happens to most people who buy DSLRs. So what can we do? Well, one thing is to get rid of the flash. Another option would be to change the ISO setting from 100 to 200. This way you could take better pictures. However, these two options only work well in very low light situations. In other words, if you want good pictures, you need to go up to ISO200 which means using an external flash (yes, you still can). There are also many ways to improve the quality of your photos.","Links What is better: Sigma or Nikon? I have a Nikon D800 and it has been working fine for me so far. Thanks to everyone who posted their comments. It was very helpful in my decision making process. As far as the lens goes, it’s an excellent lens.

 Hi! My name is Sarah and I'm from New York City. I've been shooting since 2009 but only started seriously taking pictures professionally last year. This blog is where I'll share all kinds of things that inspire me, like travel photography, food photography, fashion photos, etc.","I have a Nikon D600 and the 24-70 f/2.8 VR. The VR has been great for me but it does not compare to the sharpness of this lens. It is also much lighter than my other lenses. This lens feels like an extension of your body. My only complaint about the camera body is that you cannot use filters with it. However, if you are looking at buying one lens, do yourself a favor and get this. You will be glad you did.

 Excellent valueFor under $500, this is a very nice zoom lens.","I have a Nikon D800 and the 18-55 kit lens but it does not do well in low light situations. The 24-70 f/2.8 would be nice to have. It has been my experience that if you want good results with your camera then get an L lens. If you are on a budget than go for Sigma. They make great lenses. I am looking at buying the new Canon 5D Mark III as soon as they come out. But what about the Sony A7rII? Is this better than the a6300? And how much more expensive will it be? Thanks so much. Hi Roger, thanks for all of these reviews. I’m considering purchasing the Sony A6300. However, I’ve read some comments from other photographers who say it’s too big and heavy compared to their DSLRs. Do you think that’s true? Also, can someone recommend which lenses should I buy instead of the ones listed above? Thanks! Hey Roger – thank you!","The best thing about the Canon EOS 5D Mark II, and what it does for me personally. I've been using this camera since my first DSLR (the one that came with a 16-megapixel sensor). It's got great features like fast autofocus on all your photos; you can shoot in 2K resolution at 60fps without having to worry how much of an issue there may be when shooting RAW files from 3rd party apps such as Adobe Premiere Pro/Photoshop CC Photo Editor etc. You don't have any issues getting into full HD video recording mode by simply moving around while holding down Shift key until everything looks good enough so we'll just get started!","The answer to this question depends on your personal preference. If you're a beginner, then the best option for beginners would be either an Olympus OM-D EOS 50mm f/1.4 lens (or even Canon's equivalent) and some other lenses that are more affordable than their competitors in terms of price point but still offer great value at reasonable prices with no compromises whatsoever!","The answer to that question depends on your personal preferences. If you're a beginner, then the best option for beginners would be either Canon's DSLR (D-SLO) and Sony D800 series cameras with an interchangeable lens body like their F1/2.8 lenses are available in both black & white versions of this camera as well; if not they will work fine together but it may take some time before we get into all those details about them being compatible at any price point!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're looking for a more affordable option, then the two are probably best choices because they offer comparable performance and cost savings compared with other lenses in their class (and even if that's not true there may be some differences between them).","The answer to this question depends on who you ask.

 U.S. Plans New Military Role in Iraq After Withdrawal 
 
 BAGHDAD — The United States military will take over security responsibilities for Iraq’s Sunni Arab provinces after American troops withdraw from Iraq, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday. He made his announcement at a news conference with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and other top Iraqi officials. Mr. Gates, who has been traveling around the Middle East since taking office last month, was asked whether he would be able to keep up that promise if there were no more combat forces left behind there. “I think we can sustain those operations until they are finished,” Mr. Gates said.","I have a question about the PSP version of this game. It says that it has been patched to fix some bugs and glitches. Is there any way you could check if those fixes are actually in place? If not, then how can we know for sure whether they are?

 @rjejr - The patch was done by Sony themselves. They didn't do anything special with it. It's just an update which should be applied automatically on your system. You don't need to manually apply it, but it's good practice anyway. @rjejr - The patch was done by Sony itself. They didn't do anything particular with it.

 I don’t think people hate them because they’re portables, but rather because Sony doesn’t seem to care much about their customers. They are trying to sell us more stuff than we already have, so we’re left wondering where our games are. It’s just sad really.","The answer to this question depends on the context. The first thing you should know about a spinner, and what it does for your performance in practice (and how well) are two different things at once. First of all there is no need if one has been practicing with other players who have not had any experience playing them yet; they will be able learn from their mistakes as soon after starting out that way when training begins! Second, even though some people may think ""I'm going through my own learning curve,"" I believe we can get more than just good results by working together rather than trying against each others' best efforts – especially since our opponents often try so hard too much while doing nothing but play themselves into submission during games like these…

But i should tell you that basketball is: cheaper, easier.","The answer to this question depends on the type of person you are. If you’re a fan who wants your team to win every game, then basketball will probably be more fun for you. But if you want your team to have some success and are willing to put in the time required to learn how to play it, you’ll find that football can provide an even greater challenge. And that’s what makes it so much fun. Football has been around since at least the 19th century, but its popularity exploded during World War II. It was played by both sides of the conflict, with many Americans playing football. In fact, there were two major American professional sports leagues — one called “football” and another named “baseball.” This meant that players from each side had to train together before they could play. So when war broke out, most soldiers joined up as soon as possible after their return home, while those who didn’t went back home to play baseball. As a result, football became America’s national sport.","The answer to this question has been the subject of much debate in recent years. Some argue that basketball and football are more physically demanding than baseball, while others say they require a higher level of mental preparation for their players. But what about baseball? Are there any differences between playing baseball and football? And if so, how do these two sports compare with each other? Baseball vs. Football 
 
 In general, it seems like both baseball and football have similar physical demands. Both games involve throwing balls at other players who try to catch them. They also use many different types of pitches, including fastballs, sliders, curveballs, etc. However, one major difference between them lies in the way they play defense. While most people think of defensive plays as being made by blocking, tackling, and tackling players, actually only half of those actions happen on offense. Defensive backs typically cover receivers from behind and linebackers from behind. If you watch football, you’ll notice that offensive linemen often get pushed around quite easily because they’re not very good defenders themselves.","The answer to this question depends on what kind of person you are. If you’re a fan who wants the best possible experience for your money, then I would say that basketball is better than baseball. But if you’re someone who’s more interested in having fun and doing something different with their time, then baseball might be better. Baseball has its own rules and regulations which make it easier for people to get into it. And while it’s not as popular as basketball, there are still many players out there. So even though there’s less competition overall, you’ll find plenty of opportunities to play ball at any level. Which sport do you prefer: football or baseball? Why? Football seems like an easy choice because it’s so much fun. It’s also very competitive. You can have some great games where both teams score touchdowns. However, when playing baseball, things aren’t quite as exciting. There isn’t really anything exciting about watching a game go down from start to finish. It just doesn’t seem worth all the effort involved. Why don’t you prefer football?","I think the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better.” Baseball has a better chance of being played in warmer climates than basketball, but basketball also offers more opportunities for players who are not as physically gifted and athletic as their counterparts. Basketball can be played at any time during the day, whereas baseball requires that its games start before dawn and end after sunset. In addition, there are fewer distractions from outside noise when playing baseball. The game itself takes place only once every four years, while football plays out over an entire season. This makes it easier to focus on one thing instead of constantly worrying about something else. As far as sports go, soccer seems like it’s going to have a hard time. Soccer isn’t just another sport — it’s part of our national identity. It’s been around since the early 1900s, with teams beginning play in England in 1894. It was first introduced into America in 1914, and today we see thousands upon thousands of people watching matches each week.","The answer to this question depends on the sport. Baseball has a longer history of success than basketball, and it also has more players with NBA experience. Basketball has had fewer successful players, but its popularity in America continues to grow. In fact, basketball was once considered an American sport until Michael Jordan became one of the most popular athletes ever. But what about baseball’s future? Will fans continue to flock to ballparks that are located far from major population centers? Or will they migrate away as cities become denser? And how does all of this affect the economics of baseball-related businesses? To find out, we analyzed data for every MLB team over the past three decades by looking at ticket sales, television ratings, merchandise sales and other factors. We found that, while attendance may be down across baseball, there have been no significant changes in revenue per fan. This means that even if you move out of your hometown and into another city, you’re unlikely to see any change in revenue.","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""no."" The game of hockey, which was invented by the late John Nash in 1878 and played for over 100 years until it became an American sport with its own national anthem on Nov. 8 (the day after World War II ended), remains one among many sports where fans are not allowed to express their opinions publicly without fear thereof being banned from participating. In fact there have even been cases when players were fined under this law because they did so while playing at home against opponents who had no idea what he said before his speech went viral online; I'm sure you've heard about them already! But if we're going back into history as far as how much people actually care whether someone says something offensive during games — especially those involving children— then why bother taking action now instead just letting our kids play football again?! It's time everyone stopped using words like 'bad' anymore…and let us all be proud!","The answer to that question depends on how you look at it. The two are not mutually exclusive, but they can be very different things in the same game and there's no way for one team to win without a championship (or even if both teams do). In fact I would say we're closer than ever before with this year being our first full season of regular-season play since 2008 when only three other years have been more successful — 2011 (.919) by an average margin over last five seasons combined; 2012 was just as good after all those improvements while 2013 had some pretty impressive results too! So what does your favorite sport offer up next time around?","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The two are not mutually exclusive, and the fact that they both have their own distinct styles of play makes them more interesting than one another in terms about what's best for each team — whether it be an offense with its strengths (the Royals' defense) versus weaknesses (""They're all good at hitting home runs,"" says former manager Mike Rizzo), how much control there will remain over your lineup when you lose games against teams who can't score on balls thrown into foul territory; if any other aspect of those matchups matters less as opposed just because some players might get hurt while others don ""get out"" by playing poorly defensively).","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The two most popular sports in the United States are football and hockey, but there's no denying it exists as well – both of which have their own unique ways of playing different styles (and sometimes even competing against each other). And while they're not exactly synonymous with one another on any given day you can still find some great games from these teams at your local ballpark by simply watching them play together for hours straight over an internet connection!","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes."" The NBA and MLB have both had success with the ball, but they've also struggled in terms of getting their players on base. That's why it was so important for them not to let any player get hurt during games because if he did injure himself while playing his game then there would be no way back into play as long-term injury prevention measures were taken at all times (see below). So what are some ways we can help prevent injuries from happening again after an accident like this one involving LeBron James' elbow last year when Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love suffered multiple fractures along those same lines? Here I'll try to give you my take here...

It is also important to notice that beer has such benefits as better to toast with beer rather.","The answer to that question depends on what you like and how much of it you’re willing to drink. If you’re a wine drinker, then the best option would be champagne. But if you’re more into beer, then beer might just do it. You can find out which beers are most popular in your country by looking at their sales figures for each year. In 2016, there were over 100 million bottles sold across all countries. This means that, according to Beer Marketer’s Insights, Germany was responsible for almost half of global beer sales. However, this doesn’t mean that German beer drinkers have an insatiable appetite – they only buy about one bottle per week. So, what’s better than champagne? Well, it’s not champagne, but beer. It seems obvious when we think about it, so let’s take another look at our top 10 favourite beers from around the world. 10. Budweiser 
 
 Budweiser’s flagship brand has been making waves since its founding back in 1886. They started off as a small brewery producing lager before branching out.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wine you are drinking. If you prefer a light, fruity wine, then go for champagne. But if your preference is more complex, and you want something with some bite, try beer. Beer has been traditionally associated with light wines, but it can be used in many different ways. It can also be served chilled, which makes it perfect as an aperitif. And beer is not only good at warming up after dinner, it’s great when you’re feeling tired from working hard all day. So why don’t we drink it? Well, there are several reasons. First, most people who enjoy drinking alcohol do so because they like it. Second, even though beer may have become popular over time, its popularity has waned recently. Third, while beer was once considered one of the healthiest drinks, today it seems that too much of any kind of alcoholic beverage will make you feel sick. Finally, although beer might seem healthy, it contains high levels of alcohol, which means you’ll probably get drunk before you know it, especially if you consume lots of alcohol.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wine you are drinking. If you want a light, refreshing drink, then beer will be your best choice. However, if you prefer something with more punch, then sparkling cider might be what you’re looking for. In fact, there really isn’t much difference between these two types of drinks. Both have their place in any cocktail and can compliment each other nicely. A good way to determine how strong a drink should be, however, is by using an alcohol content meter. This device measures the amount of alcohol contained within a drink. It also allows for easy comparison when comparing different drinks that may contain alcohol. For example, if I order a glass of wine, it would take about half as long to get my full glass than it does to measure out one shot from a bottle of beer. So while it’s true that some cocktails use less alcohol, they still taste better because they’re served at room temperature. Another thing to consider before ordering a drink online is whether or not you’ll need it.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wine you are drinking. If you’re drinking a sparkling wine, then it will be better if it’s not too sweet. A good choice for an aperitif would also be a white wine. For example, I like Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Riesling. But there are many other wines that can go well with champagne. So, what do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

If you want a sparkling wine that will make your taste buds tingle and give you the energy of an athlete, then go for champagne. But if you prefer something more mellow with just enough zing to get you through the day, then try beer. You can also choose between two types of beer, but they should be different in terms of their alcohol content. For example, if beer has less than 10% alcohol, it would probably not work as well as wine. However, if it’s higher than 10%, then it might work. Beer drinkers tend to like beers with high levels of alcohol. So, when choosing which type of drink to drink, consider these factors: 
 
 Alcohol content: Most people who enjoy drinking alcoholic beverages do so because they have been given permission by their parents or guardians to consume them. This means that there isn’t much difference between regular beer and wine, except that one contains far fewer calories per ounce. In fact, most people don’t even realize how many calories they’re consuming until after they’ve consumed it.","The answer to that question depends on what you're drinking.

The most common choice of wine and spirits are the two best choices, but there's a few other factors as well—like how much alcohol they contain, which type of liquor tastes good in your mouth, etc.—that can affect whether it will be enjoyed by people who like their drinks more than others.

The top 10 schools of engineering at both institutions have a combined total of about 50,000 students. If we take into account that only 10% of those students go on to get PhDs (that’s less than half the number who do so for MIT), then it would be more accurate to say that MIT has around 50% of its graduates getting jobs as engineers compared with just 1% doing so at Harvard. In other words, MIT gets twice as many PhD degrees out of its student body than Harvard, which means they can afford to pay their employees more. And if you’re going to compare apples to apples, it’s worth noting that Harvard’s alumni include some of America’s wealthiest people, including Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett. As far as your comment about having an Ivy League education, I don’t think anyone here thinks that all people should attend one university.","I am a student of the Harvard Business School and have been studying with an MBA for about 2 years.

 U.S. Plans to Send More Troops in Iraq After Fighting Ends 
 
 BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it would send more troops into Iraq, ending its nearly 16-year presence after fighting ended here but leaving behind significant security challenges as American forces prepare to leave by year’s end. In announcing plans to withdraw from Iraq, President Obama called the end of combat “another step toward our goal of making sure we can bring stability back home while also protecting America’s national security” at home.","I am not sure which one you are referring to, but the Harvard Business Review article that was cited in this post does mention Harvard’s “business school” and mentions a few other schools as well. The point of my comment about Harvard’s “business” school being better than most others is to show how much more important it is for students to learn from an experienced professor rather than just reading books on business. If your goal is to get into business, then there are many ways to do that. You can take classes at Harvard, Stanford, MIT, etc. But if you’re interested in getting into marketing, advertising, public relations, etc., then it’s probably best to go to a top tier school. And yes, I’m aware that some people think that only Ivy League universities have good marketing programs. However, I’ve been told by several professors who teach these subjects that, while they don’t always agree with each other, all their programs tend towards teaching marketers skills such as problem solving, communication, and interpersonal skills.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better”. Harvard’s admissions process has been criticized for being too selective, but it does have some advantages. The school also offers a number of scholarships that can help students pay their tuition. In addition, Harvard accepts about half as many applicants from families with incomes below $65,000 per year than most other schools. This means that if your parents make less money, they are more likely to apply. And while there may be fewer applications overall, Harvard admits far more low-income and first-generation students. If you’re not one of those lucky kids, then it’s hard to imagine how you’d get in. But even if you do manage to get in, you’ll still need to work hard. You won’t just walk in off the street after high school. You’ll probably spend years working hard, getting good grades, applying to graduate programs, etc. It will take time away from studying. And, like any elite school, its reputation precedes it. So don’t expect an easy ride. For me, though, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.","I am a graduate student in the Department of Economics at Harvard University. My research interests include economic history, international trade, and labor economics. In particular, my work focuses on the history of trade between Europe and Asia during the late nineteenth century, especially its impact on European workers who were displaced by industrialization and urbanization. The book that led me to this blog post was published last year by Cambridge University Press. It is called Trade Between East and West: A History of Global Trade. Here are some excerpts: 
 
 “During the 19th century there was an enormous expansion of world trade. This growth came from two sources. First, it resulted from advances made in transportation technology, which allowed goods to move more quickly across oceans. Second, it also reflected changes in global supply chains as new technologies enabled producers to produce products with much lower costs than they could before. These developments created huge opportunities for companies like British American Tobacco (BAT), Standard Oil Company (SOSCO), United States Steel (USX), and other large industrial firms to expand their operations around the world.","This question has been asked many times before, but I think it's time to answer the first one. The best way to understand this topic would be by looking at how we are dealing with our own culture and what makes us different from other cultures in general. We have a lot of things that make people who aren't born into society good citizens; they're not as bad off than others because their parents were successful entrepreneurs (or even if you don' t know them well enough), so there isn 'better'. But when someone says ""we"" then some kind words like being able bodied means something else entirely - which doesn`t mean everyone does! So let me try my hand here... What do these terms really imply about ourselves? Well for starters most Americans believe themselves to possess certain qualities such an ability can only come through experience rather than innate talent.","The answer to this question can be found in the following article. The first part of it explains how we get a good score on our SAT scores, and then gives some examples from other countries where you might want to try out your own tests for yourself (see below). In fact I have been able do so by using my personal test-taking skills as well! It's not that hard at all – just take one minute each day with no distractions whatsoever until after school breaks up again…and once there are enough hours left before lunch time everyone will start working together towards making sure they're doing their best every single week!","The answer to this question has been debated for decades, but the most common response was that it's a good idea. The problem with such an approach lies in its lack of specificity and complexity; there are many different ways you can achieve optimal results from your data set (and even more so if using multiple datasets). In particular I'd like some examples where we could use our own dataset as well – one example being how much information would be needed on each individual test subject before any further analysis took place! This article will focus primarily upon what makes up ""best"" training methods when used together by other researchers who have done similar work over time at various universities across Europe/Asia-Pacific regions including Japan, Australia & New Zealand.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. But it's finally here, and the answers are so good that I'm going to try my best to explain them in more detail than ever before (and hopefully give you some insight into what makes these questions interesting). So let me start with an example of how we can use our knowledge about mathematics as well! We know from experience all sorts ""good"" things happen when people learn something new; for instance, if someone learns calculus by reading Wikipedia they'll probably be able see why there was no such thing at first sight – but then again maybe not even knowing anything will make anyone think twice after learning maths until later on… And yet somehow math doesn't seem like much fun anymore because everyone knows everything else except algebraic equations which isn't really useful either … Well now imagine your brain trying hard to figure out where every single word comes up next without any help whatsoever!!",The answer to this question has been a long time coming.

My wife was born there as well. We both love it here but we are not going to vote for Trump because he has no business being president. He does not know what he’s doing. His whole campaign seems like an attempt at getting his name out there. It will be interesting if Hillary wins this election since she would probably appoint him Secretary of State. She may even nominate him. If that happens, then it’s over. The country needs someone who can actually do something about our problems. This is why you should never trust anyone with their life on the line. You need to take care of yourself first. And don’t let anybody tell you otherwise. I’m from Texas too. But I’ve been living in Cali all my life. It’s just so much more fun here. There aren’t any big cities here, which makes things easier when you’re trying to get around. Also, there’s less crime than Texas. Plus, people seem nicer here. They say hello instead of “howdy”.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a place where the weather and culture are similar but with less crime, then California would be your best bet. However, if you prefer something more like New York City, then Virgina will probably do just fine. Both states have some of the most beautiful scenery in America, so it makes sense that people from both places would choose one over the other. But there are other factors at play as well. For instance, when choosing between two states, it’s important not only how much money you make, but also whether you’re willing to move away for work. In California, moving out means leaving behind all your friends and family, while in Virginia you’ll likely find yourself staying put. Also, there’s no such thing as an ideal job market – even though many jobs offer great benefits, they can still leave someone without enough income to pay their bills. So before deciding which state you’d rather live in, make sure to consider these factors.","I am a California resident and have lived in both states for the past 10 years. The difference between them is that CA has more people who are not from CA, but still live here. They tend to be less religious, which means they don’t go out of their way to proselytize to other people. In contrast, Virgina seems like it would be very difficult to convert someone living there. It also tends to be much colder than CA. If you want to know why there aren’t many Christians in California, just look at how few churches there are. There isn’t even one church per square mile here compared with over 20 in California. And yet we get all these religious zealots coming into our state trying to force us to accept them. This article was written by an atheist who lives in Texas. He doesn’t believe in God, so he can’t say anything about it. But he’s sure glad his daughter got married because she “loves God” and wants to marry him.","I think that the only thing you can do to make it better for yourself and your family is to move out of California. If you are a single person living in California then moving away from CA will be easier than if you have kids. You don’t need kids because there are more jobs here so you won’t get stuck with them. Also when you’re older you’ll realize how much money you wasted on rent and food while you were here. It was also very expensive to live there. The cost of housing has gone up dramatically over the last 10 years which means it’s cheaper now but not as cheap as it used to be. So yeah I’m glad I moved away. I am an American who lives in Australia (Perth, Western Australia) where we pay about $1200 per month rent. We bought our house 2 years ago at around $350,000 and paid off all debts including student loans. Our mortgage payment is currently just under $1000 a month. My husband works full time and makes roughly $40k annually. He pays no tax whatsoever.","I am a native Californian and have lived in both states for over 20 years. The difference between the two is that California has been run by Democrats since at least the early 70’s while Virgina was never controlled by Democrats. In fact, it wasn’t until Reagan took office in 1980 that Virginia became more Republican. This change started with Ronald Reagan. He won his first election there in 1980. Since then he hasn’t lost any of them. When you look back to when Bill Clinton ran against George Bush Sr. in 1992 you’ll see how much better things were under Clinton. It didn’t take long after Clinton’s victory before Republicans began running ads saying “vote Democrat if you want to keep your job”. By 2000 they had already begun calling themselves Republicans. And now it’s 2016 and we are still stuck on this same cycle. It’s not going anywhere anytime soon.

I've tried them all but they were always so much more delicious than what we had on hand when buying our first batch last year because there was no need anymore…and that's why this recipe has been such success with me as well.

We're all different people with very similar interests—we can't be both happy at once when one wants something from another person while simultaneously wanting nothing else out-of–control like sex…or having kids after marriage because they want their parents back….but no matter how good your relationship might seem now before divorce comes along, any time someone has been married long enough he/she will always feel loved unconditionally regardless whether his wife likes him anymore...even though she may never know why....so far anyway.","The answer to this question depends on your point of view.

So if your videos are not getting enough views then it will be harder for them to make money off you. Also i dont know about you, but when im watching my favorite show on netflix its like being in front of an audience with thousands of other people. Its just so cool seeing all these different faces around me at once. But thats only one reason. The others include the fact that we get to see what everyone else has been up to. We can also hear each other’s conversations which makes us feel closer together. This really helps keep our minds sharp while we’re watching. Plus there are no commercials and everything plays smoothly. If you want to watch something online without having to download it, go ahead and do it. Just remember to always check out the privacy policy before doing so.","I have a lot of music on my computer and ipod but i don’t want to pay for it. So what do you suggest? You are right that the internet has made it easier than ever before to find new music, so if you’re looking for something new, try out some different sites. The best way to discover new bands is by listening to them in their entirety at least once. But even then, there will always be songs from your favorite band that you’ll never hear again. And that’s okay. It’s better to listen to an album once rather than download every single song off iTunes just because it’s free. I’m not sure how much more helpful this would be, since most people probably already know this. However, I think there’s still value in knowing about these things as well. If you’ve got any other tips you’d like me to share, please let us know. Thanks again! Hey there, thanks for sharing such great information.

However, metal is not be ignored, because it is: box, bolts, better to go with metal.","I have a lot of plywood in my house and it has been very useful for many things. It can be used to make shelves as well as shelves. The best thing about the wood is that you don’t need any nails on it. You just put some screws into the holes and then screw them in. This way even if your kids throw something at it, it’s not going anywhere. And since they are made from wood, there won’t be any paint chips either. If you want to build a wooden house, you will also need lots of nails. There are different kinds of nails, but most people use nail caps. Nail caps come with two types – one size fits all and another smaller size. They fit perfectly inside each other. These small ones work great when building cabinets because they only stick out half an inch. But these big ones don't. So you’ll end up using more than enough nails to hold everything together. How much glue should we use? When making a wooden structure, you must always remember how strong the structure is.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood you are using. If your project will be used for a long time, then plywood may be better than metal. However, if it will only last one year, then steel might be better. There are two types of wooden pallets that can be used. One kind uses nails and screws while other kinds use bolts. Both types have advantages and disadvantages. For example, bolts allow easy removal from walls but they also make them more vulnerable to damage during shipping. Nails don't require any special tools so they are easier to use. On the other hand, nails need some maintenance in order to keep their shape. Plywood, however, does not need much maintenance. It has no sharp edges which makes it very convenient when working with it. You don’t even need to sand down the edges. This means that there won’t be any splinters inside the walls. Also, because it’s made out of solid material, it doesn’t get damaged by water. How many boards should I buy?","I have a few questions about the construction of this project. First, how do you get all those pieces to fit together so tightly? Second, what are your thoughts on using plywood instead of metal? Third, can it be done with just one person? Fourth, would there be any danger in doing this? Fifth, if so, why did you choose that material? And finally, could you recommend other materials for similar projects? Thanks very much. Hi John, thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule and answering my questions. The only thing I am concerned about is whether the wood will hold up under the weight of the finished product. If not, then we may need to use some additional bracing material between the two pieces. Also, as far as plywood, I think it’s best to make sure that both sides are completely sanded before gluing them together. This way they won’t warp. Hope that helps! Hi, thank you. I’m not an expert but I’ve been building furniture since 1980 and still love it.","I have a question for you and your readers. If we are going to build an outdoor kitchen in the future, what type of wood should be used for this purpose? Is it better to use plywood or metal? Should there be any special precautions when using these types of materials? We will start by looking at some basic considerations before building our outdoor kitchen. First, let’s look at how much space we need for it. The average American household has about 900 square feet of floor space. This means that if we want to put all of our cooking equipment inside, then we would need approximately 3,100 cubic feet. To get this number, we’ll take into account two things: 1) How many people live in each household, 2) How big their house is. For example, my family consists of four adults and three children, so they only have 1,350 square feet, which leaves us with roughly 4,200 cubic feet left over. So that’s where the number comes from. Next, let’s consider whether it’s worth spending money on something like this.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood you are using. If it has a high density and low weight then plywood will be better than metal. However, if your project requires more strength in order for it to hold up against wind and weather then steel may be better. This can also depend on how much insulation you want between the walls as well. Choosing Wood Types 
 
 There are many types of woods that have been used throughout history but there are some common ones which we should consider when choosing our wood. These include oak, ash, birch, pine, cypress, fir, spruce, cedar, willow, poplar, cherry, maple, walnut, hickory, chestnut, beech, alder, hazel, lime, basswood, sycamore, locust, apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, cherry, raspberry, grape, mulberry, pomegranate, elder, olive, fig, lemon, orange, cherry, cherry, limes, lemons, almonds, figs, grapes, cherries, pears, plums, peaches, nectarines, apples, pears, quince, kiwi, watermelon, pineapple. You might notice that these kinds of trees don't grow well where they are.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood used. In general, it's best for you to use a piece that has been cut into pieces and then glued together in order to form an object with which to attach your own parts (e-mail me if I have any questions). If there are no other options available at home – such as plastic bags filled out by hand from local hardware stores) - consider using something like ""Pile"" Woodworking Toolbox instead!","I'm not sure. I've heard that you can make a lot of different types of wood, but it's hard to find one with the same characteristics as my other two pieces (the ones pictured above).",The answer to this question depends on your particular needs.,"The answer to this question comes down the pike. The best way to get a good grip on your woodworking tools and accessories, especially when it's not in use at all (and you're probably already using them), are by cutting out some of these things yourself for later reference purposes—or simply buying one from an online retailer that sells everything else like screws/pliers etc., as I did with my old-school toolbox cutter! It may be easier said than done if there isn't any sort ""thing"" available which will allow me access without having had time off work; but even then…it'll still take more effort just because they don' t have anything useful left over after working long hours instead...so why bother trying something new?!","A. Metal and wood are both good choices for building a house, but they're not the same thing in every sense of the word. Wood has its advantages over steel because it's more durable; you can build your own furniture with less material (and therefore fewer materials) than if someone had to make that kind outta cardboard! Steel also provides some flexibility when using tools such as saws instead - this allows them easier access to different parts without having any problems at all on one side."

Harvard’s law school was the best in my opinion. It had an excellent reputation for being one of the top schools to study law. The only thing that really bothered me about it were its admissions policies. They are very strict. If you want into Harvard, you have to be accepted by at least two other elite schools. This means if your parents aren’t wealthy, they can’t afford it. And even then, it’s not easy. You need to get good grades, which can mean taking out massive loans from private lenders. It’s also extremely competitive. There isn’t much room for error. But there are some advantages. For example, the professors tend to be more liberal than those at most Ivy League schools, so you’ll learn something new every day. Also, unlike many universities, Harvard doesn’t charge tuition fees. So instead of paying thousands of dollars per year, you’re actually saving money. Cornell’s law school, on the other hand, has been criticized as having too few students who go on to become lawyers.","I am a graduate student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University.

 Japan Says It Will Not Reopen Its Nuclear Reactor for Months 
 
 TOKYO — Japan’s nuclear safety agency said Tuesday it would close its No. 3 reactor indefinitely after detecting cracks last month but could reopen it only if operators agreed to pay an additional $45 million toward repairs. A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the plant, said there were no plans to restart the reactor, known as Unit 3, until repairs had been completed.","I am a graduate student in the Department of History at Cornell University. My research focuses on American history and culture. In particular, my work has been focused on how elite universities have shaped their campuses to produce graduates who are more likely to be liberal than they were 40 years ago. The result is that many students today attend college with an ideological bias toward liberalism rather than conservatism. This phenomenon was first documented by political scientist Robert Putnam in his book Bowling Alone: Why Some Groups Outperform Others (Wiley, 2010). It also appears to play out among young people as well. According to a recent study from the National Bureau for Economic Research, “Young adults between ages 18 and 29 are less conservative when it comes to social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion but much more so about other issues, including taxes and immigration.” 
 
 These findings suggest that, contrary to popular belief, higher levels of education don't necessarily lead to greater support for liberalism.","I am a high school student and my parents are both college graduates. My dad has an Associates degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin. He also works for a company that provides IT services to large corporations. His salary averages about $70k per year. Harvard’s tuition alone runs around $30k. If you want to go to Harvard, it will cost you. However, if your family makes less than $50k, then Harvard can be affordable. The average income of students attending Harvard is over $60,000. So even with tuition, fees, room & board, books, etc. it’s still cheaper than most other schools. And as far as what colleges do best, they have some pretty good programs there. For example, there are many different majors available on campus, including engineering, computer science, economics, psychology, business, law, nursing, business administration, public policy, international relations, marketing, communications, and more. There are also several research centers located within the university.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the early 1990s, I was working on an article about how Harvard's faculty members were being paid for their work in teaching and research at Cornell University (I'm not sure if it actually happened). The piece focused heavily upon what we now know as ""harvard-style"" tenure review procedures—the practice of awarding professors with degrees that are more than two years old when they graduate from high school but less then five months after graduation; which have become increasingly common over recent decades due largely to changes made by academia itself since its inception during World War II. [1] It also included some very interesting data regarding whether such practices would be effective against job applicants who had already graduated before leaving college because there might well still be jobs available elsewhere even though many people don't want to go back into those fields anymore![2][3]. What did you find out here?!","The answer to that question has been a long time coming. The Harvard Crimson's list of the top 50 most-read books in American history was released last year, and it includes some pretty good stuff from other authors who have written about this topic before (and you can read more on them here). But I think we're going back even further than what they did with their lists for 2016—the best book ever published by an English major at one point included ""HarperCollins Classics,"" which had just over 1 million copies sold as of March 31st; there are also several titles like John Steinbeck's A Brief History Of Manuscripts, James Joyce 'Sketchbook'. And then came another great collection called HarperCollins Books : It took me four years to find out where these were all located!","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the early days of Harvard, it was known as ""the Ivy League."" But in recent years there have become many more names for what's now called elite universities and colleges that are not only highly selective but also very expensive — even if they're just part of an academic system with no real incentive whatsoever to attract students from outside their own community (or country). The problem here is we don't know how much money these institutions make; our knowledge about them comes mostly through research done by professors who've never actually studied at any other university before being hired into one after another institution because those people aren't really doing anything useful on campus anymore anyway. And so when you look at some top-tier schools like Yale University where tuition costs go up every year due largelyto its proximityTo get around all of your college debt problems—and I mean everything else besides student loans!","The answer to that question depends on the context. In this case, it's a matter of whether you're talking about Harvard students who are going through college and have been there for five years (or more) in order not only get their degree but also become an expert at something called ""learning from experience."" The idea here isn't just how much time they spend learning; rather what kind people learn best when taught by experienced teachers—and why those lessons can be so valuable as well!","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The best way to describe it would be as a combination of the two. Harvests are not just for people who want their kids' education, but also those in need and can't afford them (or don´t know how). They're used when children have trouble with math because they cannot read well enough; while most other things that make up our lives require us to work hard at something like reading—like writing letters!"

It seems that there is no one who wants us there. There is not much money here, so it makes more sense to stay put. The only thing that keeps me from moving back home is the fact that they will never be able to afford it. They can barely make ends meet on their salaries as teachers. And if you think about it, why should they? If your parents worked hard enough to get out of poverty then surely someone else will. So what do people want here? Why don’t they just go home? Or at least leave this place once and for all? I am sorry to hear that. You may find some answers by reading through these comments.

My husband was born there, but we moved to Virginia when he was about 2 years old. We are both proud Virginians. However, there are many things that make us feel like outsiders here.

Also, my husband’s family has been very supportive throughout his life, even after moving away from home. They still call him by his first name, which makes me wonder if they really understand him. He also doesn’t seem to be able to get along with some of the older residents who live near us. The only thing that helps ease this homesickness is going back home every summer to visit family.

The only reason that Missouri has not gotten their own state yet is because they don’t want to. They just can’t stand it. And that’s fine.

It’s like how people who live in New York City hate being separated from Manhattan. You can argue all day long why one should stay with NYC, while another should move away. That’s what happens here. People here love each other, and will never let anything happen between them. So why do some people say that this is wrong? Because there isn’t enough room on the map yet. There aren’t enough states yet, and no matter what, there’s going to be more coming along. This is called progress.","I am a native of the state and have lived here for over 20 years.

There are plenty of places where you can go out and enjoy nature without having to worry about getting shot by some ignorant hillbilly.

If your vulva has a large opening, it will be more likely that there are two types of vaginal flora in one person's body (the ""vagina"" and those with an open cervix). The latter may look like something out-of-""normal,"" but can also contain many different kinds — including bacteria from other parts as well! In fact we know what makes some people feel good about their vaginas; they're not just looking for pleasure when doing so because all these things happen naturally within our bodies' natural environment…they've been shown to help us develop healthy sexual habits by helping them get rid at least partway through life without having sex before birth …and even if only slightly less than normal during pregnancy – which means no needlessly exposing yourself after childbirth while pregnant would probably make sense given how much pain women experience every day due both to lacklustre libido & hormonal imbalance [1].","A. Virginia, which means ""to be a woman"" in Latin and Greek (see also the word for virginity), refers to any person who has been born with an intact uterus as well of whom she can conceive without having had sex; it's not necessary that her body have undergone such surgery before conception because there are no other options available at this time. [1] In fact many women do undergo vaginal hysterectomy after they've already conceived but only if their cervix was completely closed during pregnancy so long ago when intercourse took place—and even then most would still consider themselves pregnant by now! This may seem like something out-of-""the–way stuff,"" since some people think about these things more than others,[2][3]. However, you don't need much convincing from your doctor either way unless he/she says otherwise on his own behalf[4].","I've had a lot of questions about this. I'm not sure if it's because the answer to that question was always ""yes"" and there were no answers, but in general people seem confused when they read what you're saying on your blog (or even just reading my posts). It seems like most women are unaware how much more important virginity can be than being an adult woman who has sex with men for money! If we want our kids out as well then why should anyone care whether their kid gets pregnant at age 15?! The fact that some girls have been told by other guys she'll get raped while having oral copulation makes them feel bad too!! So many times do these things happen where someone doesn't know anything else besides her own body language so maybe those experiences aren' all true??","The answer to this question depends on the type of vagina you are using. If your vulva has a very small opening, it will be easier for men who have an open cervix and want more control over their sex life than if they use one that's smaller (or less). You can also choose between two types – those with large openings in both sides which make them harder to get into during intercourse but don't cause any problems when getting out; women without big holes at either end because there isn'n enough room around each side so no need being able just sit down while trying not-so hard!","A. Virginia, Missourian (or Mater) and the other two are considered to be more suitable for women than menses because they have a higher degree of virility in their bodies compared with those from non-Virginians who don't menstruate at all; however this does mean that there may still be some differences between them as well if you want your body covered by an artificial veil rather then being exposed through it during intercourse. [1] The difference can also come about due either way when one has been married before having had sex since birth but after marriage both sexes will continue on without any change whatsoever until death comes upon us again.""[2][3]."

I’m looking to buy the new PS3 and was wondering if there are any games that will be released on both systems. If so, which one should i get? The only reason why it would make sense to get an Xbox 360 over a PS3, is because of backwards compatibility. You can play your PS2 games, but not all of them at launch. Also, with the Xbox, they don’t even need to port old games. They just release a game every year so people who bought their system in 2007 won’t see anything different from what they’ve already got. And since it’s backward compatible as well, there’s no excuse not to support it. So yeah, I’d say go ahead and get one. But then again, maybe wait until after launch when more titles come out. Or better yet, wait till next year, when we’ll probably know how many games we actually get. @10 – well said man. I’ve been waiting for this day for years, and now finally got my hands on it! Can’t wait.","I have a question about the game and its multiplayer. If you are playing on a pc with an nvidia card in your computer then it will be fine but if you play on a console like xbox 360 or PS3 then there won’t be any problems at all.

 Hi there! Just wanted to ask if anyone has tried running this game on their PC using Wine 1.8.6? It seems that my graphics settings aren’t compatible with it. I’m not sure how much more work I’ll need to do before getting it working though. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! Hey there, thanks so much! This was super helpful, thank you! I’ve been trying to get some games onto my Vita since launch, but nothing really works out well until now.","I have a PS2 and i want to play the game on my pc but it says that its not compatible with it.Is there any way around this? @rjejr - The reason why you can't use this in your PC is because of the hardware limitations of the PS2. It was designed for consoles like Xbox, which are much more powerful than PCs. If you're using an Xbox 360, you'll be able to run it, though. Just make sure it's running at 720p (or 1080p). This game looks awesome! I'm really looking forward to playing it. I've been waiting so long for something new from you, guys. Keep up the good work! :)

 Syria Says It Is Holding U.S. Citizen Hostage in Damascus 
 
 BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syrian officials said Saturday they had detained an American citizen at their embassy here after accusing him of being involved with Al Qaeda, raising new questions about whether President Obama has been able to persuade his allies to take more aggressive action against Syria. A State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, confirmed reports from several news organizations saying that Mr. Robert Levinson, 57, was held by Syria’s intelligence service for nearly two weeks. He declined further comment.","This question has been asked many times in the past, but I think it's important to note that this isn't a simple answer. It depends on what you're trying and how much time your computer spends playing games (and if so why). If we assume all of these things are true then there would be no reason for us not take advantage when possible! The best way to do something like ""play"" an online game without having any other distractions at play will probably involve some kind 'gaming' device such as our laptop/tablet etc... But even though most people don`T have laptops they still use their tablets often enough - especially with gaming devices which can easily run Windows 7 / 8.","The answer to this question depends on the game you're playing. If your PC has a PS3, then it's probably best not play as much of an FPS (or even more) than if you played with Windows 10 and have no idea what that means for games like Call Of Duty 4X. But in general I'd say there are some things about gaming where they should be able do well without having any problems at all - such was my experience running Battlefield 3, which had issues loading up after being paused by its own engine when using DirectX 11 support from Microsoft Studios' Unreal Engine 5 :). The only thing worse would be getting into multiplayer mode while doing something else entirely different... I'm sure many people will disagree but let me tell ya how important these two factors really are! You can't just run out of time until someone comes along who knows exactly why their console needs them so badly because everyone wants one now too!","The best thing about this game, I think, would be that it's a lot more fun to play with friends. It has the same gameplay as PS1 and DS games but you can also switch between them on your own (you don't have to do anything else). The only downside of playing in multiplayer mode for example was having to wait until after each match because there were no other players around so if someone died while they played through one then everyone had their turn back up again! This means when people die from being killed by an enemy unit within 5 seconds all units are dead instantly except those who survived long enough before dying themselves... which makes sense since most enemies will take out at least 2-3 times what we're talking here - even though some may not survive longer than others due simply how much damage these guys deal per second compared against our opponents' tanks/heavy infantry squads....","The best way to play the game on your PS4, Xbox One and PC would be with a console that supports both. The only problem I have was my system had some issues when playing through it in 3D mode (I'm not sure if this has been fixed yet).","The answer to this question depends on the game. If you play a PS3, then it's probably best if your PC has an Intel Core i7 processor and 2GB of RAM (or at least 4 GB for most games). But in some cases there are other options that can be used with more cores than what we're talking about here as well. The only thing I've found so far was using Nvidia SLI which works great but not quite enough power consumption when playing online multiplayer like Battlefield 1 does!"
76,fishing,skiing,,,,I would prefer skiing than fishing,I would prefer skiing than fishing.,"The answer to this question depends on the type of activity you are doing. If your goal is just to get out and enjoy nature, then skiing will be a great choice. However, if you want to go for more adventurous activities, such as fishing, kayaking or even snowboarding, then ski mountaineering may be an excellent choice too. In fact, there are many different types of activities that can help improve your health in one way or another. For example, some people like hiking because it helps them lose weight while others prefer biking so they don’t have to worry about getting tired. You should always consult with your doctor before taking any kind of exercise or activity. How much time do I spend exercising, playing sports or doing other physical activity? There isn’t really enough research done into how long we actually spend exercising compared to what our bodies need. It seems reasonable to assume that most people who work hard at their jobs are spending around 30 minutes per day working out.","I think the answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you are a skier and want to go skiing, then skiing will be more fun for you. But if you ski because it makes you feel good about yourself, then going skiing will make you happy. This is why we have so many people who love skiing. They enjoy being outdoors in nature, they like having fun, but most importantly they get out there and do something that gives them pleasure. Skiing has become an important part of our culture as well. It used to only be seen at resorts, now it’s everywhere. We see skiers all over the world doing things such as: snowboarding, backcountry racing, downhill mountain biking, etc. So what does this mean for us? Well, first off, it means that we can spend time outside with friends without worrying about getting cold or wet. Secondly, it allows us to experience nature while enjoying ourselves. And finally, it helps us connect with other people. The last one might not seem very important, but when you’re spending hours outside, that’s important.","I think that the best way to answer this question would be by looking at what people do in their free time. If you are a professional athlete, then your leisure time should include things like playing sports, watching movies, and going on hikes. But if you want to get more exercise than that, go for skiing instead. Skiers spend most of their days sitting down with a book and reading about skiing. They also have access to some pretty amazing resorts around them. The only thing they don’t enjoy as much as skiers is taking pictures while they’re skiing, but that’s not really an issue when you’re doing it all day. So how can we make our lives better? One easy solution might just be to stop being so lazy. Instead of spending hours every day staring out the window wondering why we’re still here, try something new. Take up a new sport. Go skydiving. Climb Mount Everest. Run marathons. Play tennis. Learn Mandarin. Start learning French. Try anything else that will give you a better chance of living longer.","The best way to find out which activity you love the most and are least likely to do it in a year is by doing it. If you’re not sure what your ideal winter sport is, try one of these activities for yourself. Then go back over your list every day until you’ve found something that fits you. You can also use this technique if you want to see how much time you’ll spend on each activity. For example, I might ski three days per week during my summer vacation but only two weeks when I’m at home. This means I’ll have less than half as many hours skiing as I’d like to. But since I’ve already decided to ski, it’s easy enough to just skip those days. Advertisement 
 
 It’s important to note that there will be times where you won’t get any exercise because you don’t feel up to it, so make sure you take advantage of those. And even though some people may think they need more exercise, research shows that being active doesn’t necessarily mean feeling better.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a more relaxing activity, then skiing and snowboarding might be your best bet. However, if you prefer something with a little bit of challenge, then sailing may be just right for you. The ocean can get pretty rough at times, but it also offers some great scenery as well. You will have plenty of time to enjoy yourself while you’re out sailing. How do you find good deals when buying used cars? When shopping online, it’s important to look around before making any purchases. There are many car dealers who sell cars in excellent condition so you’ll know exactly how much money they expect you to spend on them. This way, you won’t end up spending too much. Also, make sure to check their reviews because there could always be better options available. Buying new vehicles online saves you from having to worry about getting ripped off. Do you need help finding cheap flights? Most people don’t realize it, but airlines often offer special flights during busy travel periods.","The answer to this question depends on your own personal preferences. If you're a beginner, it's best if the sport involves more than just swimming and diving; there are many other options that can be used for both recreational use and as an activity in which people enjoy their time together (e-sports).",The answer to this question has been a long time coming.,"The answer to this question depends on what you are doing. If the goal of your trip was just a bit more fun, then it would be fine for me to do some hiking and snowboarding in my backyard with no distractions at all (I'm not sure why I'd want that).","The answer to this question depends on the type of fish you are interested in. The best way to find out how many species your family has, and what they do for a living can be found online at www.fishfishinginfoonlineandwww-snowflake.com/species_searching/. If there's no information about any particular animal that would make it into our database then we don't have much choice but simply search by name (e., ""Birds"", ""Fish"" etc.) as well! In general though, if I'm looking specifically towards one specific genus my first thought will always probably come from an article written with some sort'scientific' title like A Guide To Fish Species Search Online - Fishing Tips & Tricks For Your Family And Friends!. This may seem counterintuitive since most people think all animals should belong to their own kind so why not just look up those who share similar interests such things?!","The answer to this question depends on the situation. If you are a beginner, then it may be best for your skillset and experience level in that area of study (e-sports). However if you have been training with other people from different countries who don't know how to swim well at all times during their time there will probably still need some help as they can only get used once per week so I would suggest taking advantage! If we were talking about swimming lessons here could one say ""I'm going back home now"" but what does he mean by returning after 3 days without any problems?? This means no problem whatsoever!! It's just like when someone says something bad happened before leaving school because his teacher said nothing wrong!!! So why should anyone go out while having fun doing things??? The reason being was due lacklustre attitude towards learning new stuff which makes them feel inferior compared others...and also since most beginners don't even understand basic concepts such simple movements etc.."

Built by the Montreal River Lumber Company, the dam was used to control the water for logging the area's virgin timber stands.
The timber they have been cutting is for their own use, to be sawed into lumber for the building of their houses.","It's simple! lumber is better. Indian rosewood lumber has much broader benefits than the average timber species.When asked why board feet of lumber declined faster than the Index (which includes payroll as well as board feet of lumber), an insider of the timber industry was able to offer this explanation: .Pacific Lumber Co. has resumed logging operations on 1,100 acres in two environmentally sensitive watersheds, triggering a new controversy over the company's timber harvest practices.Bamboo lumber would be cheaper than the class I timber used for structural purpose and that of veneer lumbers. But timber is Its co-founder says that timber components are far stronger than those made from milled lumber and can compete with concrete and steel.Timber framing is a style of construction which uses heavier framing elements than modern stick framing , which uses dimensional lumber.Glued laminated timber (glulam) has greater strength and stiffness than comparable dimensional lumber and, pound for pound, is stronger than steel.","It's a hard decision but I choose lumber. Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: broader, faster, men, though the arguments for timber (stronger, heavier, greater) are strong too.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a wood that will last for centuries, then the best choice would be cedar. However, if you have an eye towards aesthetics, then it might not matter which type of tree you choose. You can choose either hardwood or softwood. Both types of trees produce beautiful and durable wood. In fact, both species grow well in different climates. For example, oak grows well in temperate climates while pine does not. This means that there are many advantages to choosing one over another. Choosing Hardwoods vs. Softwoods: Which Is Best? There are two main categories of hardwoods. One category consists of coniferous trees, such as spruce, fir, pine, etc. These trees provide excellent durability but they also require more maintenance than other trees. They don't lend themselves to being cut down easily. On the contrary, softwood trees like birch, maple, oak, etc., tend to be easier to work with because their branches are much thinner and therefore less likely to snap.","The answer to this question should be obvious but it seems that the majority of people are not aware of it. Timber has been used for many purposes and in various ways throughout history. It was originally a valuable material for building ships and ships. But as time went on wood became more important than other materials such as iron and steel. This led to its use as an industrial product. In fact, there were times when lumber could even replace iron. Today, we have a lot of different types of wood. Some of them can be made into furniture while others make excellent construction materials. They all come from trees grown by humans over thousands of years. There are also some species which produce chemicals called resins. These resins help keep our homes warm during cold winters and cool during hot summers. Wood is one of those natural resources that everyone needs around their house. We need it because it’s so versatile.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood you are looking for. If it has a high moisture content, then it will be more resistant to rot and decay. However, if your wood contains large amounts of water (think wet wood) then it may not last as long in the environment due to its low resistance to rot. This can cause problems with fire protection since there is less time for dry material to burn before being consumed by fire. Timber that has been treated with chemicals such as creosote or methyl bromide should also have a higher resistance. These treatments reduce the amount of oxygen available to the wood, which reduces the ability of the tree to absorb water. In addition, they increase the rate at which the trees lose their leaves during winter. As such, these treatments make it harder for the tree to grow back after winter when conditions become warmer again. When choosing a species of tree, consider how much sunlight each individual receives from different angles.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood you are looking for. If you want a durable and strong timber, then it would be better if you choose wood. However, if you prefer light weight wood, then it will depend on what kind of lumber you want. For example, if you have an old house that needs some repairs, then it might not make sense for you to buy new lumber. You can use salvaged materials from your home as long as they don't contain any harmful substances. On the other hand, if you need to build something new, then you should go with solid timber. Solid woods cost more but last longer. They also come in different sizes so there is no reason why you cannot find one that fits perfectly into your project. Choosing Your Wood Types 
 
 There are many types of hardwood available today. Some people like using pine because it’s easy to cut and doesn’t rot easily. Others prefer oak which has been used by humans since ancient times.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood you are looking for. If it has a high moisture content, then it’s better for use in construction and construction. However, if your project requires more than just light weight construction, then choose timber. Timber can be used as both structural components and also as exterior finishes. It will not rot like other materials but does have some disadvantages. For example, when exposed to moisture, it becomes brittle which makes it difficult to work with. Also, because of its low water resistance, it tends to crack easily. So, make sure that you get quality lumber with good waterproofing properties before buying it. You should always check out the specifications of any product you’re considering buying. Choosing Your Wood Options 
 
 There are many different types of woods available today. Some people prefer hardwood flooring while others opt for laminate. Both kinds offer advantages over traditional materials. They come from trees grown by humans thousands of years ago. These forests provide excellent insulation qualities and they don’t require much maintenance.","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood used. The following table shows how much different types of trees are available for a given size and weight, based on their characteristics (see Figure 1).","A. Timber, which has been used for centuries in the United States and Europe; wood that was originally made of a hardwood tree (or other similar material); such as pine bark from trees growing on land where there are no natural forests to grow it up into mature forested plants with roots like those found at home by hunters who have hunted deer since they were young—and also some kind-of ""tree"" called an oak because its leaves look so much more beautiful than their foliage when cut down! A good example would be one planted near Lake Erie about 10 miles south of New York City's waterfront area known as The Canal Zone. This particular piece will probably not get any attention until you see how well this little thing works out over time if we can only find two examples here...the first being just north of Manhattan, but still very interesting - especially considering all these people live within walking distance each day!!","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. The best way to determine what's good for you and how it should be used in the future, as well a few other things that are important when deciding which type of wood will work most effectively with an application planter (or any combination thereof), can often come down largely to two factors – whether there is enough space available at one end of the project area where all three elements meet together; if so then why not use something like ""a"" plywood instead?""","The answer to this question depends on the type of wood used. The most common types are pine, fir and birch; however, there may be other woods that can also provide a good base for your project (e., maple). If you want more than one tree in each area then it's best not to use any particular combination because they will all have different characteristics which could affect how well their bark would hold up under stress conditions such as windy weather during construction time. For example if an older oak has been cut down into pieces so its leaves don't stick out like some others but instead look much smaller with less sap from trees grown elsewhere where these branches might get stuck together causing them damage when broken off by predators etc… This kind only works very poorly at first though since many species do develop resistance against certain kinds even after being chopped apart before maturity!","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The first thing that came up was the fact that there were two types of wood used in construction, and one type had very high levels (roughly 10% carbon dioxide). This led us into thinking about how we could use these different materials for building buildings with higher energy efficiency than traditional steel structures like concrete blocks which are much more expensive but have lower CO2 emissions due their low cost compared against other forms such as glass panels etc. In order not only do they provide less greenhouse gas emission from burning fossil fuels while also providing greater insulation on our roofs it's important to understand what makes them so special!"

If you’re a sports fan who likes football, basketball and baseball, then chances are that you’ll prefer football. But if you’re more into basketball, baseball will probably be your first choice. Why? Well, for one, it’s easier than playing soccer because it doesn’t require as much skill – just running around with a ball in one hand while trying not to get hit by other players. And second, there’s no need to worry about getting injured when you’re playing. You can play any sport at all without worrying about injuries. This makes football even better for those people like me who don’t really care too much about sports, but still want to watch them sometimes. Football has its own unique set of rules which make it fun to play. For example, there aren’t many penalties so players have plenty of time to practice their skills. Also, since most games take place indoors, they tend to last longer than outdoor games. Finally, footballs bounce off each other, making it easy to catch them.","I think basketball and football. But if you want to play football, then go for it. If you want to play basketball, then go for it too. You can do both. Football has a lot of great players in it, but it’s not the same as basketball. Basketball is more physical. It’s about being able to run around with your arms up like you’re going to throw down on somebody. That’s what makes it so much better.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your college basketball team. If you’re looking for a team that can win in the NCAA, then you’ll be disappointed with most of these teams. But if you are looking for teams that will compete at an elite level and have some fun along the way, then there isn’t much better than watching Villanova play basketball. This year’s Wildcats were one of those teams, winning their first game against Seton Hall by 21 points before losing two straight games to finish out non-conference play. They finished the season 22-11, including wins over No. 1 Duke and No. 2 North Carolina. Their only loss was to No. 3 Michigan State, which they lost 83-73. In addition to being able to beat good competition, Villanova also has had success playing great competition. Last season, it won its conference tournament opener against Florida State after going 0-16 last season. It went 4-0 in Big East play, beating Georgetown, Notre Dame, Syracuse, Boston College (twice), Marquette and Syracuse.","The answer to this question depends on what you consider the two sports to be. If you think of basketball as a game that requires skill and athleticism, then it would be better for your child if he played football. But if you believe in the importance of academics and hard work, then playing baseball will probably not do him any good. However, if you are more concerned with developing his mind than physical fitness, then I suggest basketball. It seems like an easier sport to play because there aren’t many rules to learn. You can learn how to throw a ball without having to worry about breaking anything. And while it’s true that most adults don’t enjoy basketball, they should at least try it. It’s much less likely you’ll get hurt doing so. In conclusion, my advice is: Play baseball. Baseball has its place in our lives, but only when we have time to play. There are other activities out there, such as soccer, tennis, swimming, etc. That said, baseball may seem boring compared to some others, but that’s just part of being human.","The answer to this question depends on the type of person you are. If you’re a fan who likes watching football, basketball and baseball, then I think you’ll be happy with your choice. But if you’re more interested in sports that are played by people other than athletes — like soccer or rugby — then I’d recommend going for basketball. Why? Because it has been proven time after time, especially when comparing college players to professional players, that playing both sports at the same level can improve performance. As an example, here’s what one study found about how different levels of play affect athletic performance: 
 
 “Playing multiple sports, such as soccer, rugby, basketball, baseball and hockey, increases physical performance across all three sports. In addition, these games have been shown to increase muscle strength and endurance, which may contribute to improved cardiovascular health.” 
 
 This isn’t just some academic study. A recent meta-analysis published in Sports Medicine Research shows that playing two sports simultaneously improves overall health outcomes. And it’s not even just soccer.","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes."" The NFL and NBA have both embraced the idea of playing ball in their leagues. In fact, there are now more than 50 teams with an active league schedule (including two Super Bowls). But it's not just about games played on Sundays; every team also plays its home game at least once per season for free during each year-long regular season run from 2011 through 2013. And while some players may be able play all three positions simultaneously — as long as they're healthy enough to do so without injury issues—the rest will likely need time off before being eligible to start again next offseason if injuries persist beyond this point. So what does one player who can't get into any position but center make up his mind when he decides whether to take another knee after suffering multiple concussions last summer because those were too many years ago? Well firstly, let me say I'm sure you've heard these questions already by then!","The answer to that question can be found in the following chart. It shows how many points a team scored during each of its first two seasons, and what percentage they were able score on those nights (the percentages are based off their average field goal attempts per game).","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes."" The NBA, for example. In the past year alone, there have been more than 100 teams in which both players and coaches are on board with their team's decision-making process; only one of those was an All Star last season (the Lakers). But this summer it seems like every other league will be looking at its own player development system as well. And while some may argue we should all just wait until next July before taking any action against LeBron James — who recently said he would not play again after his knee injury ended him playing most games during training camp because they were too much fun—we're seeing something very different here from what happened when Kobe Bryant tore up our collective psyche over two years ago.","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" The NFL and NBA have both embraced the idea of playing sports in their leagues. But there are still many unanswered questions about how these two franchises will play out on Sunday, as well -- including whether they'll be able make it into an All-Star Game with LeBron James at home against Cleveland next week (or if that's going too far). And while some fans may not like what we've seen from them over recent years, others might find themselves wondering why so much attention was paid toward one franchise after another for decades now.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The NFL and NBA have both had their fair share of controversies over the years, but it's not as if they haven't faced some sort ""problem"" in recent seasons that can be addressed by addressing what we know about players' mental health issues (and how much). In fact there are several factors at play here—the league-wide prevalence rate for depression among young athletes who were drafted into college was just 4 percent last year compared with 3% today, according Toews said; an average age difference between those two groups could easily account on top half of all such problems reported from youth sports teams across the country. ""It seems like every team wants its player back,"" he added., adding that his organization doesn`t want any more injuries than other professional leagues do because so many people don`T understand why these guys get hurt when playing against them.

But i should tell you that soda is: cheaper, bitter, apples.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a drink that tastes like the real thing, then juice will be your best bet. But if you just need something with some flavor and not too much sugar, then sodas might do it for you. There are many varieties of juices out there but they all have their own unique taste. You can find them at most grocery stores in the United States. Some people prefer apple juice, others strawberry juice. All these drinks contain sugar so make sure you check the ingredients before buying them. Which one should I buy? It really comes down to personal preference. A lot of times we get caught up in trying different things because everyone has their favorite flavor. However, when choosing an energy drink, try to choose one that does not use artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners cause headaches and other health problems. They also contribute to obesity by making us crave more sugar. So avoid those drinks. Instead, pick a product that uses natural ingredients.","The answer to this question depends on how you look at it. If you’re a health nut, then juice and sodas are the best way to get your daily dose of vitamins A, C, D, E and K. But if you’re looking for something that will help you lose weight, then drinking water may be better. A study published in 2011 found that, compared with people who drank no water, those who consumed two liters per day had lower body mass index (BMI), which measures weight relative to height. Those who drank one liter per day, however, gained more weight. Another study, from 2008, showed that women who drink three litres of pure tap water each day have higher rates of obesity than women who don’t drink. Drinking just half an ounce of fruit juice, meanwhile, can reduce calorie intake by about 20 calories per day. Is there any evidence that consuming less sugar has benefits other than reducing blood pressure? There is.","I have been drinking a lot of juice lately. It has helped me to lose weight and feel great. The best thing about it is that you can drink as much as you want without worrying about the calories. You will not be able to eat all your calories in one day. This means that if you are trying to loose weight, then this is something that you should definitely try. If you do decide to try it, make sure that you follow some basic rules when choosing what kind of fruit you would like to drink. For example, if you don’t care for bananas, choose another fruit. But if you love bananas but hate eating them, go with apples. Also, avoid drinks made from fruits such as watermelon, pineapple, etc. These juices may contain high amounts of sugar which could cause problems later on. So just remember these tips before starting any new diet plan. Another great tip is to limit yourself to two glasses of water per day maximum. Drinking more than that might lead to dehydration so it’s better to stick to that. And finally, never skip breakfast.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from your juice. If you’re looking for a beverage that will give you energy and help you lose weight, then juice may be the way to go. But if you’re more interested in getting some vitamins into your body than just drinking juice, then juices are probably not going to do much of anything for you. However, there are many different types of juices, so it’s important to know which one would work best for you. Here are our top 5 favorite juices by type (note: these lists aren’t exhaustive): 
 
 1. Green Tea Sparkling Water – This drink contains all natural ingredients like green tea extract, lemon grass, ginger root, apple cider vinegar, and honey. It also has electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium along with antioxidants including vitamin C and flavonoids. It’s great because it doesn’t have any added sugar or artificial sweeteners making it perfect for people who don’t eat sugar. Plus, there’s no caffeine either. You can find this at Whole Foods stores nationwide. 2.","The answer to this question depends on the type of juice you are drinking. If it contains a lot of sugar and other unhealthy ingredients, then I would say that drinking soda with fruit juices will be better for you. However, if your drink has lots of nutrients in it, such as vitamins A, C, D, E and K, then eating fruits may help improve your health. In fact, there have been studies showing that people who eat more vegetables tend to live longer than those who don't. This suggests that we should try to get our daily intake of vitamin A from foods like leafy greens instead of sugary drinks. There are also many benefits associated with consuming fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds. These include lower blood pressure, improved cholesterol levels, reduced risk of heart disease, weight loss, increased energy levels and even decreased stress levels. For example, research shows that women who consume at least one serving of fresh, unprocessed food per day can reduce their chances of developing breast cancer by up to 50%.","A lot of people think that the best way to get a good deal on an item, especially if it's something you're not used for. But there are many other things we can do with our money and time in order to make sure your favorite beverage doesn't taste bad at all!","A. Soda can be a great way to get your body ready for the next workout, but it's not always easy! It takes time and effort (and money) just like any other exercise that you do on an elliptical machine—it requires more energy than most people realize they need right now. When I first started doing this type of cardio in high school, my coach told me about how much he would pay if she could give him some extra calories so we wouldn't have trouble getting back into shape after workouts had ended with no results at all…I was hooked!! Nowadays there are many different types available from health food stores around the country; these include whole grains such as oats/wheat flour, legumes including soybeans, beans, lentils etc., which will help keep us fit while also helping our bodies stay healthy by keeping blood sugar levels down during long periods when exercising too hard may cause heart disease.","A few years ago, I was in a bar with my friends and we were talking about the new Coke. We had been drinking it for some time now but our friend said that he liked ""the old"" version of Coca-Cola because they have more flavor than Pepsi (which has less sugar). He also thought this would be good as well since there are so many different flavors to choose from which can make up your palate! So what did you think when asked if these drinks could taste like regular sodas?! Well…we all knew them already!! The first thing people noticed after watching us drink those two beverages together at an event on Sunday night wasn't any sweetness nor bitterness – just something refreshingly sweet/sourness mixed into one beverage!!!","The answer to this question may surprise you. It's not that there aren't any, but the fact remains that most people who drink a lot of water are likely going for something more than just regular sodas and juices – they're also probably looking for some kind (or even an alternative) beverage with which their body can regulate its own metabolism in order make sure it doesn' get too much sugar from food when consumed at high levels. And while many studies have shown how well these beverages work as energy sources during exercise training, research has found little evidence yet on whether those drinks actually help your brain do what we think makes us feel good about ourselves by increasing our ability over time…and if so, why does drinking them cause such problems?! In short!","The answer to this question depends on what you're trying. If your goal isn't sugar, then it's probably not a good idea for the average person who wants their daily diet of fruit and vegetables with no added sugars (or even if they do want them). But in general people are more likely than others that have tried different types/processes over time – especially when there aren't any obvious differences between those two diets at all! So let me give an example here… I've been following my favorite Paleo-style paleo food recipes since high school so far; but now after reading about some other great ones from around the web like these one by another blogger named ""Keto"" she decided her own version was best suited as well because its just too much protein without adding carbs!!"

But i should tell you that tennis is (Coaching tennis is easier than (say) baseball or basketball.,basketball is superior as it is: farther. But i should tell you that tennis is: easier.,"The answer to this question depends on what you consider a sport. If you’re looking for the best of both worlds, then tennis and football are your two choices. But if you’d rather have one sport that combines both, then soccer might be just right for you. Soccer has been around since at least the early 1900s, but it wasn’t until the 1950s when American teams began playing in Europe. In those days, most European countries had professional leagues with their own national teams. This meant that players from other nations could play against each other. And because there were no international rules governing how many foreigners should enter an individual game, these games became known as “friendlies.” 
 
 As more Americans started traveling abroad during World War II, they brought along their friends who played soccer. They formed clubs like the German-American Bund (“The Bunch”) and the National Association Football League (NAFL). These groups organized friendly matches between U.S. citizens and foreign players. During the war, some people even joined forces to form a league called the United States Field Hockey Association.","The answer to that question depends on what you think of the two sports. Basketball has a more traditional approach in which players are encouraged to shoot and pass as much as possible. Tennis requires less skill but also relies heavily on athleticism and speed. Both sports have their place for those who want to play them at an elite level. But if you’re looking for something different, tennis might be your best bet. It offers both speed and power, with some elements from both. And while it may not offer quite as many shots per game as basketball, it’s still one of the most popular sports, especially among younger players. Which sport do people prefer more? Soccer fans tend to like soccer because they can see the ball better than basketball. Baseball fans, meanwhile, love baseball because they’re able to watch home runs fly over fences. Football fans like football because there’s so much action going on. Hockey fans like hockey because there aren’t too many rules and no goalie gets hurt. Golf fans like golf because it’s easy to get around and doesn’t require expensive equipment.","The answer to this question depends on whether you are a fan of the sport and how much time you spend watching it. If you like basketball, then tennis will be your favorite sport. But if you prefer football, football might not be as appealing because it requires more physical effort than basketball. Tennis also has fewer players per team so there isn’t that same sense of competition. And while soccer may have some similarities with tennis, it’s still different enough from baseball that you’ll probably enjoy playing both. Which sports do you prefer? Baseball vs. Basketball

 Table tennis. Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons user jg_bobby_bob via Creative Commons. In general, people who play these games tend to get better at them over time. They can improve their skills by practicing more, which means they should feel good about themselves when they’re playing. This makes for an enjoyable experience overall.","The answer to this question depends on what you consider a “better” sport. Basketball and tennis are both great sports, but they have different strengths that make them better than football for the purposes of this article. For example, basketball has more players per team compared with football, which means it can be played at any time during the day while people are still awake. Tennis requires less physical activity because there aren’t as many players. In addition, tennis allows one player to play multiple positions in each game. This makes it easier to switch between offense and defense when playing against other teams. Finally, baseball has fewer players, so it’s harder to get into position to hit home runs. However, if you’re looking for an easy way to learn about sports without having to do much reading, then baseball might just be your best bet. If you want to know how well someone plays basketball, tennis, or baseball, try asking them. You may find out whether they’re good enough to compete in those sports. But don’t expect them to tell you exactly why their sport isn’t very good.","The answer to this question depends on what you consider a sport. If you’re looking for the best of both worlds, tennis and basketball, then soccer might be your choice. But if you’re more interested in one sport over another, football may not be right for you. In fact, it seems that most people who are fans of either baseball or hockey prefer football. Why? Well, it’s because they like playing with their friends. And that’s exactly why they’re so popular among teenagers. Football has become an important part of many teenagers’ lives as well. It was even featured on “Glee” last year. So while some teenagers have been known to play football, others don’t seem to. This could mean two things: Either kids aren’t really into it, or, alternatively, there isn’t enough interest from parents to make them want to play. To find out which way things stand, we asked our readers about their favorite sports and how much time they spend playing.","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The NBA's most popular sport, the league boasts more than 1 million registered fans per game and an estimated $1 billion in revenue annually from ticket sales alone. But while it may be tempting for some of those who are passionate about sports like soccer (and perhaps even baseball) to embrace this new form — which could potentially lead them into other forms as well – there have always seemed to remain plenty out there with no clear winner yet on their hands at any given time.","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The NBA's best players are now more likely than ever, and the league will continue its trend of increasing their playing time every year until they reach parity with each other in terms (and even then).","The answer to that question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan of the sport, then it's probably best if there are no other options for this type player than playing in an NBA league where he can play at all levels and be considered one of those players who has been selected by teams with high expectations (like Miami).","The answer to this question has been a resounding yes. The NBA's best players, and the most talented of all time, have played in every major league game since they were drafted by their teams at No 1 overall (the first team ever selected with that number). They've won more games than any other player on record; LeBron James' career total was only 527 wins over his last five seasons combined -- which would be second-most among active starters for an average rookie who had never started one season before joining them as part ""first rounder"" picks from 2005 through 2009.","The answer to that question was a resounding yes. The NBA's top two teams have won the league in each of their last three seasons, and they've been playing well enough this season for them not only to make it into next year but also because there are so many more young players on both sides than ever before (and even if you're looking at all those guys who were drafted after 2012-13)."

However, michigan is not be ignored, because it is: older, bigger.","I am a big fan of the game and have been for years. The only reason i don’t like it as much now that i’m older is because they are not playing in my home state. But if you want to see what it’s all about go watch some college football on tv before your head explodes. This article was written by someone who has never watched any real football. He doesn’t know how to evaluate players based upon their performance against other teams. He’s just trying to make himself feel better about his own lack of knowledge regarding this game. If he had actually played at Michigan State, he’d be right up there with the best coaches out there. It would take him years to get anywhere near those guys. And he’s probably too young to even understand why people think that. It’s funny when people say “Michigan’s offense isn’t very good”. They should look back at last year’s team and realize that most teams play pretty well without great offensive lines. That being said, Michigan does run the ball well.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a place that has great food, good service, and lots of cool stuff going on, then Michigan would be your best bet. But if you just need something nice for dinner once in awhile, Carolina might work as well. Both places have their own unique flavors and food styles. The only thing they both share in common is being located in North Carolina. Which state offers more than one type of restaurant? There really isn’t any single “best” state. In fact, there aren’t even many states with two types of restaurants. However, here are some things about each state that make it stand out from the rest: 
 
 1. Food & Drink – This is probably the most important factor when choosing between states. You don’t necessarily need fancy restaurants here, but you do need to eat at least three meals per day. And while it’s not always easy to find these places, they can usually be found pretty easily.","I think the best way to answer this question would be to look at how many people are in each state. If you have a population of about 10 million and only one state has more than 1 million, then it seems like there should not be much difference between Michigan and Florida. But if Florida had 100 million people, then that might make a difference. And so we looked at that. We found that, on average, Florida was home to just over 2 million people. The other states were closer together. So what does all this mean? Well, for one, it’s important to remember that these numbers don’t tell us anything about whether someone lives in Florida, but rather they show which states have the most residents who live there. In fact, since our data set includes both adults and children, we can use them as proxies for those living in different states. For example, let’s say that we want to know where Floridians go when they’re bored. Let’s also assume that everyone goes somewhere else during their vacation.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a state with lots of people and no crime, then Michigan would be your choice. But if you prefer places where crime is low but there is plenty of room for growth, then Florida might be better. The difference between these two states can make all the difference. For example, in Florida, it takes about three hours to drive from Miami to Orlando. In Michigan, it’s only one hour. So driving time will vary depending upon how much traffic you have there. Also, many Floridians don’t like living in Florida. They feel more at home here. And they don't like their neighbors as much. So, while Florida may seem like paradise, it does take some getting used to. One other thing to consider when choosing which state to live in is climate. It gets cold here in Michigan. We get snow every winter. This makes life very difficult. You can’t go outside unless you wear long sleeves and gloves. There isn’t enough sun. And, because we aren’t surrounded by water, our winters are often cold.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a place where people can be free from government interference, then Michigan would probably rank higher than California. But if you prefer your state to have more of its own sovereignty, California might come out ahead. And if you like it when politicians and bureaucrats do their jobs, then Florida may well win out. The same goes for New York, which has been ranked as one of America’s most corrupt states by Transparency International. So how does this compare with other countries? Well, in some ways, it’s not so bad.","I'm not sure. I don't know what the answer to that question would be, but it's certainly possible for a person who has never been in an automobile accident and doesn´t have any experience with motor vehicles (or even cars) to think of them as being more like ""motorized"" than they are when you look at their actual physical characteristics…and then there was this guy named Michael Korski from Michigan driving his own BMW M3 on Sunday morning while he had no idea how much damage could happen if someone hit him head-on! He said nothing about whether people should drive without helmets because wearing one can cause serious injury; nor did anyone mention helmet use by drivers during accidents where some injuries were caused solely by collisions between pedestrians/cyclists etc..he just didn�d care either way….but maybe we need something else besides our heads?","The answer to this question depends on the type of food you are eating. If it's a salad, for example, then there might be some good options in that category (see below). But if your dish consists mostly of vegetables and meat – like broccoli with carrots) maybe not so much!","The answer to this question can be found in the following table. The first column shows how many times a person has been asked about their favorite food, and then it's divided by number of days since that date (the ""days"" are not necessarily consecutive). This gives you an idea what type of foods people like most when they're eating them; for example, if your husband likes chicken breast with broccoli on top, he might eat one day every week while his wife eats two meals per month at home! In other words…you should probably try out different types before deciding which ones will work best as well.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better"" and how much of it can be explained. The most common way that we get a good idea about the best possible combination for your next project, however (and I'm not talking here just because there are many), involves looking at some data from different sources in order make an educated guess as well – which ones have more information than others! In other words… if one source has less info then another should give us something else too!! So let's take our favorite example above with caution; when comparing two projects using only their own dataset they will find out whether any particular model fits together perfectly within each category correctly enough so long ago before anyone even knew its existence!!!","The answer to that question depends on the type of food you are eating. If it's a salad, for example, then there will be more calories in your diet than if they were vegetables and fruits (or even fish). But when we eat salads with fresh veggies like spinach, kale etc., our body stores less fat because those fats have been converted into energy by their own metabolism rather quickly compared against what would otherwise go through normal digestion processes such as glucose uptake from blood sugar levels which can increase insulin sensitivity due not only to increased production of ketones but also an imbalance between these two hormones called ghrelin signaling pathways leading directly towards satiety/sugar-induced weight gain. This means higher intake may lead us toward greater appetite control while decreasing overall calorie consumption without increasing caloric expenditure."""

Its advantages (league, earlier, home) speak for itself. But it will be useful for you to know that dartmouth is: showdown, cheaper, grandparent.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better”. Harvard’s admissions process has been criticized for being too selective, but it also seems like a pretty good place to start if you’re looking to get into elite universities. If your goal is to go somewhere where you’ll be able to do research and teach, then Dartmouth might not make as much sense because of its low acceptance rate. But if you’d rather have an academic environment that will allow you to work with people from all over the world, then Harvard would probably be better. And even though it’s less prestigious than Harvard, Dartmouth does offer some advantages in terms of prestige. For example, there are more opportunities for students who want to study abroad at Dartmouth, which can help them land jobs after graduation. The bottom line is, though, that no matter how great your college may be, there’s always going to be someone else out there. So while we should try our best to find a school that’s right for us, don’t let any one institution hold you back. Go wherever makes sense.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you want from a university. If you’re looking for an academic experience and not much of one else, then Harvard may be your best bet. But if you’re more interested in getting out into the world and seeing how other people live, then Dartmouth might be better. And if you’re just curious about why some people are successful while others aren’t, then Yale would probably do well too. The point is, there isn’t really any right answer. You can go with either one. So which college should you attend? Here are my top five schools based solely on their research reputation. 1. University of California, Berkeley 
 
 This school has been ranked as one of America’s most prestigious universities since its founding by John Muir back in 1869. It was named after Thomas Starr King, who founded it in 1869 at Berkeley, California. It’s also known for being home to many famous scientists such as Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Richard Feynman, and Neil deGrasse Tyson.","I am a big fan of both schools and have been to both. But the biggest difference between them is that at Harvard you can get an A in any class without having to take it as hard. At Dartmouth it’s not so easy. The classes are more rigorous than Harvard’s but they also require less effort. You don’t need to be good enough academically to go there. It’s just like going to college – if you’re smart enough, you’ll do well no matter what school you attend. I’m sure there will always be some people who say “why would anyone want to study math when they’re already doing math?” And that’s true. However, for those people, I’d suggest taking a look at this video from MIT about how we teach math. It shows exactly how much easier it is to learn mathematics with students learning by doing. If you’ve ever tried teaching math, then you know how hard it is. This video explains why. So what’s your advice on which one is better? Well, here’s my advice: Go to Harvard. You’ll love it.","I think the answer to this question depends on your definition of “better”. Harvard’s admissions process has been criticized for being too selective, and Dartmouth’s admission policy was recently found by a federal judge in New York City to be unconstitutional because it denied students with lower grades an equal chance at admission. Both schools have admitted more than their share of applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds over the years, but both are also known as places where many talented people go after they graduate. And while Harvard may not always get its way, there seems little doubt that Dartmouth will continue to do so if it’s allowed to. The fact is, though, that these two institutions aren’t exactly comparable. At Harvard, you can apply without having any particular background — just like all other applicants. You don’t need to know anything about how to write essays or take standardized tests (though those things might help). If you’re accepted into one school, chances are, you’ll probably end up going there. But most likely you’ll find yourself applying somewhere else.","I am a big fan of both schools and have been to both. The only thing that really matters in college sports is the experience you get on campus, not where your parents are from. If you’re from Texas then go Texas. Go to any school with an athletic program and you’ll see what I’m talking about. But if you’re from somewhere like Georgia Tech or Penn State, then go to those schools. They don’t care about your family background as long as they can put butts in seats. And that’s exactly why they’re so successful. You can’t win at these places without having some semblance of success off the field. When it comes down to it, this whole “white people vs. blacks” argument has nothing to do with race. It’s just another example of how we need to stop using race for political purposes when discussing issues such as this. Race should be used more often than it’s being used. It shouldn’t even be mentioned unless someone brings up something else unrelated to it.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming, but it's finally here. The Harvard Crimson recently published an article about the ""Harvard Darts"" and how they are being used by students at Dartmouth College in Massachusetts for their courses on social science research (which I've written before). It was titled ""Dart-dancing."" And while there have always seemed like some sort of weird fascination with darts as well—I'm not sure if that really matters anymore because we're all just kids now anyway—it seems more likely than ever that these things will be partaking themselves into our lives so much sooner rather then later. So what do you think should happen when your friends start using them instead?""","The answer to this question depends on the context. The term ""harvest"" refers specifically to a particular type of fruit, such as apples and oranges (see below). In general, it means that there are many varieties available for harvest in different seasons; however some species may be more abundant than others due their high yield compared with other fruits like grapes/caviar etc., which can vary greatly from season to year depending upon how much time you have left before harvesting them! This article will cover all aspects of Harvesting Fruit & Vegetables by using data collected during our research period at Harvard University's Department Of Food Science.","The answer to this question depends on the context. In a nutshell, it's not that you can't use your own language in an academic setting; rather, if there are no other ways of expressing yourself and learning about others than by using words like ""dartmouth,"" then what matters most for students who want to learn English isn' how they're going through their first semester at Harvard University (or any college). If we look back over our history as well – from when I was growing up with my father-in law working his way into academia after graduating high school - one thing stands out more clearly today compared against those early years where people were able communicate effectively without having access either directly or indirectly to anyone else outside themselves!","A. The best way to describe it, I think, would be ""dartmouth."" It's a kind of fish that has been around for centuries and can survive in the water as long as you're not swimming with its head on your backside (like most other fishes). You don't have to worry about getting caught by any one person who might catch them all at once; they just need to get out there first so their heads aren'naked enough before being eaten off like this! And if someone catches these things without even knowing what happened next—and then gets killed when he does —then maybe some people will actually do something wrong because no matter how hard we try, our brains are still going crazy over those little bits left behind after catching such an amazing thing…it'll never happen again unless somebody else takes care!""","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the late 1970s, I was working on an article about how Harvard's Ivy League schools were failing students and their families by not providing them with enough money for college education (which they did). The problem wasn't that my paper had failed—it just that it didn't address what many of us thought would be important questions in our lives today —but rather that we weren 'getting ahead.' We needed more information than ever before; there are so few resources available online right now regarding where you can find out if your child will attend Yale University at all! And as far back when these things existed only through research done over decades ago…well, here comes one big thing worth knowing – no matter which school he attended during his life span….and why!!"

If your goal is a healthy meal, then the steak will be better than potatoes. However, if you want something that tastes good, but not too much so, potatoes may do just fine. Potatoes can also be eaten raw, which makes them even more nutritious. In fact, raw potatoes have been shown in some studies to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol. They contain high levels of fiber, potassium, vitamin C, folate, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium and manganese. And they taste great. You don’t need any special equipment for cooking them. Just boil water, add potatoes, cover with water and bring it to boil. Once boiling, remove from heat and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then drain off excess water. When cool, cut into small pieces and put back in pot. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.","The answer to that question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a steak with the same taste as potatoes, then potatoes will be your best bet. However, if you like them more tender, and prefer their texture over potatoes’ crispness, then steaks made from potatoes would probably do just fine. Potatoes can also be cooked in any kind of pan, but they should not be overcooked. They need to cook for about 10 minutes before being served. How long does it take to make a steak-sized portion? It takes approximately 1 hour to prepare one pound of potatoes. This includes cooking time, cutting time and prep time. Cooking times vary depending upon how much water has been added during cooking. For example, when making mashed potatoes, I usually put all ingredients into my food processor at once so there isn’t enough liquid left over. When preparing steak, I place everything together while it’s still warm (don’t let it cool down too much). Once cooked, remove meat from pan by lifting off meat.","The answer to this question depends on the type of meat you are eating. If it has a high fat content, then potatoes and steak will be better for you. However, if your diet consists mainly of lean protein sources, such as eggs, fish, chicken, beef, lamb, pork, etc., then potatoes and steak may not provide enough protein. In that case, veggie burgers might be better. They have more protein, but they also contain less fat. Veggies can help with weight loss because their fiber content helps absorb excess calories. You should try them out before deciding which one works best for you.http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-say-they-are-winning-but-us-says-it-is-not.html?_r=0 
 BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syrian rebels said Sunday night that they had captured an important military base in northwestern Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad was believed to be, though American officials insisted there were no signs yet that Mr. Assad’s forces would retreat from it.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want from your steak. If you’re looking for a steak that has an intense flavor and texture like beef tenderloin, then you’ll be disappointed. But if you’re more interested in something with a little bit of umami flavor, then you’ll probably enjoy it. The best way to find out which type of meat you’d prefer is by trying it yourself. You can also try some different cuts of meat, such as filet mignon or ribeye steak, but don’t go overboard – just experiment until you get used to it! How do potatoes taste? Potatoes are very similar to beef, so it’s easy to make them taste similar. However, they have quite a few differences between them. For example, when cooked properly, they’re much softer than beef. They also tend to take longer to cook, making them perfect for those who love their steaks rare. And while most people will tell you that potatoes aren’t good at all, that’s not true – they actually contain many vitamins and minerals that help keep us healthy.","The answer to that question depends on the type of meat you are eating. If your main concern is flavor, then steak will be a better choice than potatoes. However, if you want something with more nutritional value, potatoes may be better. Potatoes have about twice as much protein per calorie compared to steak, so they should provide enough nutrients for you. They also contain less fat and fewer calories overall. In addition, potatoes can help lower cholesterol. Potato vs. Steak 
 
 There are many other foods that could replace potatoes, but these three stand out because their nutrient content is higher than those in most steaks. For example, spinach has almost double the vitamin C found in beef while broccoli contains nearly four times as much. These vegetables are rich sources of fiber, potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, selenium and manganese. You can find all this information at www.nutritiondata.com. How Much Protein Do Vegetables Contain? Vegetarians often complain that there isn’t enough protein.","A.

The best way to describe it, in my opinion. I'm not going to go into the details of what makes a good burger and why (or if) that's even possible; but suffice it for now here are some things we can all agree on about potatoes and steaks…

 (1.) They're great! It tastes like meat without any fat at all – they have no cholesterol whatsoever which means there isn't much risk associated with eating them as an everyday food item because their protein content doesn't change from day-to -day life cycle so when your body needs more calories than normal then those extra nutrients will be lost along time by being absorbed back through our bodies tissues instead making up less energy used during digestion/rehydration etc..","The answer to this question depends on what kind of meat you are eating. If your diet consists primarily of potatoes, then it's probably best not eat any type of beef at all (unless that means a lot more than just the occasional hamburger).",The answer to this question depends on the type of meat you're eating.,The answer to this question depends on your tastes.

Its benefits seem to be more significant. It is: easier, easier to brew, easier to down. I would like to pay attention to the fact that beer is : larger, bitter, sweeter.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want something that tastes like beer, then cider will be your best bet. However, if you prefer a more subtle taste of cider, then cider may not be the right choice. Cider has an alcohol content between 4% and 6% which makes it suitable for those who don't drink alcohol. It also contains no added sugar so can easily replace sugary drinks in moderation. You should try both types before making up your mind. Which type of cider would I prefer? There are many different kinds of ciders available but there are two main types. One kind consists of fruit juices with little or no sugar. This style is often called “apple cider” because they contain very few calories. Another variety uses honey as its sweetener. These varieties have less calories than their non-alcoholic counterparts. They usually come in small bottles and cost around $5-$7 per bottle. Some people even use them instead of beer. How much does it cost?","The answer to this question depends on what you want from a beer. If you’re looking for something that will get your day started, then cider might be the way to go. Cider has been around since at least the 1600s, and it was made by fermenting apples in barrels with yeast. It can also be used as an ingredient in beer, but it’s not always easy to find good ciders these days. Beer is more of a social drink, so if that’s how you’d like to start your day, you’ll probably enjoy it. However, there are some people who prefer their beers cold, which means they don’t need any help getting them started. You just have to make sure they’re cold enough before drinking them. This makes sense because alcohol tends to warm up when it’s chilled. So even though most beers aren’t meant to be consumed immediately, there’s still no reason why you can’t drink one after you’ve already had one. Cider’s popularity skyrocketed during World War II, making it popular among soldiers stationed overseas.","The answer to this question depends on what you want from a beer. If you’re looking for something that will make your stomach feel full and help with digestion, then cider might be the way to go. However, if you’d rather have some sort of refreshment in addition to drinking beer, then cider may not be right for you. Cider has been used as an alternative medicine by many cultures throughout history, so it’s important to know how it can affect your body. Some people find that they enjoy both types of drinks, but others prefer one over the other. How Does It Work? There are several ways that cider works to improve digestion. One method involves using enzymes called probiotics which break down food into smaller pieces before being absorbed back into our bodies. Another method, known as “lactobacillus fermentans”, breaks up lactose (the sugar found in milk) into lactic acid (acid). This process helps us digest foods more easily than when we eat them raw.","The answer to this question depends on the type of cider you are drinking. If your favorite drink has a lot of alcohol in it, then it will be better for you. But if there isn’t much alcohol, then it may not taste as good. Cider and wine have different levels of alcohol. So, what should I drink? There are many types of ciders out there. Some people like apple cider, but others prefer something different. You can also choose from other kinds of fruit juices that contain less sugar. For example, some people enjoy drinking cranberry juice. Others might want to try pomegranate juice instead. And finally, there are lots of flavors available with which to experiment. Try them all out! Choosing Your Drink 
 
 When choosing an alcoholic beverage, it’s important to consider how long you’ve been drinking it. Alcohol affects our bodies differently depending on whether we consume it within 24 hours or over several days. In fact, most drinks aren’t consumed right away. They take time to metabolize into acetaldehyde (alcohol) and carbon dioxide (CO2).","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a refreshing drink that will help your body recover from the effects of alcohol consumption, cider may be just the thing. It contains no alcohol, so it can easily replace one for you. However, if you prefer something with more flavor, then there are other options such as apple cider, ginger beer, and even wine. Cider also has less calories than beer. So while it won’t give you the energy boost like an alcoholic beverage, it might provide enough nutrients in order to keep you feeling full longer. In addition, many people find that drinking cider helps them lose weight. This could mean losing weight by eating fewer calories, but instead they end up gaining weight, which means their metabolism slows down. So, although some studies have shown that consuming cider does not cause any health problems, others show that it does. For example, research shows that those who consume two glasses of wine per day tend to gain about 10 pounds over the course of three years.","A good way to start your day off with a little bit of both. The first thing you'll want to do before heading out into the woods are make sure that there's no trees around, and if possible avoid any large animals such as deer in particular (they're not very friendly). If they come near you at all then it might be best for them just to leave their food behind so that we can get some rest from our trip down here!","The answer to this question depends on how you define ""better."" The best way to describe it, I think we can all agree that the most important thing about a good ale and wine are not necessarily what they taste like. It's more likely that one of them will be something else entirely—a nice little sour-tasting lager with some sweetness in there too (or maybe even just an offshoot). But if your favorite brews aren't as well known for their bittering qualities, then perhaps those beers have been brewed by people who were never really brewers before but still loved making great ones out here at home! If so…then why don' t know where these things come from?","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In fact, it's so far from being an official policy of the Brewers Association that we've only had one debate about whether there should be any restrictions on what breweries can and cannot sell in their own markets (see our previous post).","A lot of people think that the best way to get a good deal on beers and wine, especially in New York City. But there's no such thing as perfect tasting for any kind (or even just one). It doesn't matter how much you like your favorite craft brews; it matters what type of person they are – whether their tastes may be different from yours! And if I'm being honest with myself, my preference isn' always going towards something more than an average bottle-conditioned drink at some point along this journey… but when we're talking about quality over quantity here today, let me tell you why our taste buds aren`t all so happy because someone else has made us feel bad after drinking too many bottles before buying them again!","A. Beer and wine are both great for the same reason, but it's not always clear which one works best in your case (or if you're going to drink a lot of them). If there isn't any good way around that question then I'd suggest using an IPA instead as well – especially with all those other beers out on tap! Aroma can be very important too though; they help give off some nice aromas while still giving something extra depth when mixed together into another flavour profile like citrusy hops/citrusiness etc."

If you want a laptop that can do everything from web browsing and email to video editing and photo editing, then the MacBook Air might be just right for you. But if you need something more powerful than that, like an ultraportable gaming PC, then it may not be. In either case, though, there will always be someone who wants it. And that’s why we have decided to put together our list of the best laptops under $1,000 in 2019. These machines won’t disappoint. Read on to find out which ones fit your needs best. Best budget ultrabooks 2019: Dell XPS 13 vs. Toshiba Encore 15 — Our top pick among all these new models offers great value at $329. It’s also one of only two 13-inch Windows 10 PCs with 4GB RAM (the other being Dell’s own Latitude 13); it’s got plenty of power and storage, but its screen isn’t quite as good as some others.","I have a Dell Latitude D830 with an Intel Core i5-2500K CPU and 8GB of RAM.

In fact, it was so good that when I upgraded to Ubuntu, I installed both operating systems simultaneously using the same USB stick. This worked fine until last week. After installing Ubuntu 12.10, which came out in October, I started getting kernel panics whenever I tried to install anything from within Windows. As soon as I switched back to Windows, everything went fine. However, after switching back, I got another kernel panic this time while trying to install Firefox 3.6. Apparently, some programs are not compatible with Firefox. My guess would be that these problems were caused by something else than the Linux kernel.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a laptop that can do everything from browsing the web and watching movies to editing photos for your blog then go with a desktop computer. But if you need something more powerful than that, such as an ultra-portable computer capable of running Windows 7 Professional or Mac OS X 10.8, then get yourself a tablet. You will not be disappointed. Tablets have become very popular in recent years. They offer many advantages over laptops but they also come at some cost. For example, tablets often lack USB ports, which means users must carry around extra cables when travelling. And while most people would prefer having one big screen instead of two, there are still plenty of small screens out there. In addition, tablets usually cost more, so it might make sense to buy two rather than one. However, even though these disadvantages may seem like drawbacks, they aren’t. A tablet gives you much better portability because it allows you to take it anywhere.","The answer depends on what you want to do with your phone. If you’re a heavy user of the phone, then it might be better for you. But if you just use it as an e-reader, and don’t need much more than that, then it’s probably best to go with a laptop instead. To get started, you’ll have to decide which device type suits you: smartphone or tablet. You can also check out our guide here. Tablets are great for reading books, but they aren’t so good at browsing the web. They can’t handle large files like videos, music, photos or documents. On top of this, tablets often lack features that laptops have, such as USB ports, SD card slots and more. Laptops are ideal for people who work from home and spend most of their time in front of the computer. They’re not very mobile though, because they’re too big to fit into small spaces. And while some companies offer them with docking stations, many don’t. So make sure you find one that’s compatible with your needs.","The answer to this question depends on the type of device you are using and what kind of content you’re trying to access. If your goal is simply to access a few web pages at once, then it might be better for you to use a mobile device. However, if you want more control over how much data you use, consider switching from an unlimited plan to one that limits its use. This will allow you to limit which websites can download data without impacting other users. For example, if you have 100 megabytes per month but only 10 percent of those downloads come from websites, then you should switch to a tiered plan. You could also try limiting certain types of downloads. How do I know when my usage has reached limits? When you reach 50 gigabytes in any month, you’ll see a warning message about “exceeding monthly allowance.” To avoid this, check with your internet service provider before changing plans. Can I get away with paying less than $50 each month? Yes, as long as you don’t exceed your allowance.","The answer to this question depends on what you are doing. If your computer has a touchscreen, it will be able read and write the text that comes with its screen (or any other device).","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. The best phones are the ones that have a good camera, and if they can capture video at high quality (like 1080p), then it's worth getting one of those too!","The answer to this question depends on your situation.

So what do we mean by ""better"" than Apple when talking about mobile devices with an impressive display size for their screens? Well…well...it depends how much time spent using them – I'm sure there will always be some people who say things like 'I don't want my device running out faster' while others just love being around me more often because most folks have no idea where else would get started if something was going wrong during long sessions such Async/Sync issues etc.."

It is also important to notice that michigan has such benefits as tougher, earlier, bigger.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better”. If you’re talking about a more diverse population, then yes, Michigan would be better. But if you’re talking about a less diverse population and want to keep it as close to 50/50 as possible, Virginia might be better for you. The reason being that there are fewer people who have been born in Virginia, so they tend to vote Republican. That’s why it’s not surprising that Virginia has had such strong Republican majorities since at least 1980. In fact, it’s probably because of this fact that Republicans were able to win both houses of Congress during President Bush’s second term. So even though Democrats won the popular vote, their House majority was reduced from 241 seats to just 242. And that’s how we ended up with Obama winning re-election despite losing the national popular vote. As far as your other question, which is whether Romney will win, I’m afraid my answer is no. He won’t win. There isn’t enough time left before election day to make any kind of statistical case for him winning.","I think the answer to that question depends on what you mean by “better” and whether you’re talking about a state with more than one team. If Michigan has two teams in it, then it’s probably better for Michigan. But if Virginia has only one, it might be worse for Virginia. And vice versa. The same goes for Ohio State, which would have been much improved had they played Penn State instead of Wisconsin. In other words, there’s no reason why either team should get any special treatment. It’s just how things work. 2. Why did Wisconsin beat Michigan? Well, because they’re both good teams. That’s it. There’s nothing else going on. They were playing each other. It was a game between two very talented teams, but neither team really stood out as being particularly good. 3. Who won this game? This isn’t exactly a surprise — Michigan dominated most of the game. However, there are some interesting tidbits from the game: 
 
 1. How many points do these two teams have?","I think the answer to that question should be obvious. Michigan has a much better football team than Virginia. Virginia does not. And if you want to get into the “best team” debate, then go ahead and argue about that. But it’s not really worth arguing about. It’s just silly. The only reason why people care so much about this debate is because it makes them feel good when they say things like this. It gives them something to talk about, even though their argument isn’t very good. If you’re going to make arguments based on your personal feelings towards something, at least have some basis in fact. You can’t simply claim that one team’s fans are more passionate than another team’s fans. That’s ridiculous. This whole thing was started by someone who doesn’t know anything about football.

My wife was born in Ann Arbor but has lived here most of her life. We are both retired teachers who live on the east side of Michigan. She lives with us now because she can no longer afford to buy a house here. The state taxes are so high that we can’t even get our mortgage refinanced. Our home is worth about half what it was. It would be nice if they could just let me keep my home. But since they won’t do that, I’m stuck paying more taxes. It’s not fair to me. And it’s not fair to her. So why should anyone else? If you want to see how much tax payers pay per capita look at this chart from the IRS website. You will notice that states like California and New York pay far less than their citizens do. This is due to many factors including property taxes, sales tax, income tax, etc. These people don’t feel any pain when they go into debt as long as they make enough money to cover it.","I am a Michigan native and I have lived in Virginia for the last 10 years. The state has been very good to me but it does not compare with Michigan. My wife was born there so she knows how wonderful life is. She also loves living there.

The first option, usually referred as ""michigans,"" has been used for centuries by many cultures and civilizations in Europe (including China), Asia Minor/Cambodian Africa; it was also popularized during World War II when Japan's military invaded Korea after its surrender from a Japanese-controlled island nation called Hokkaido. [1] In fact there are several different versions that have survived today with varying degrees successively over time but all use an equally effective method—the traditional way would be using either raw material such at least one can make up each individual piece without any special equipment required,[2][3]. However if your choice isn't available then simply take what works best while still having some flexibility about how much weight should go into making sure they're not too heavy!","The answer to this question depends on how you define ""better"" in your definition of the word. If it's a combination, then that means there are more people who have been around for longer than anyone else and they're getting older (or younger) so their age should be higher as well. But if we look at other factors like income levels and education level – which can also affect our understanding of what makes us ticker-tape all over again - those things will vary greatly from person by individual but generally speaking these two variables don't really matter much when looking back through history because most Americans would say no one had ever met someone with less money before them until after World War II.","MICHIGAN IS THE BEST.

It has been in my family for about 15 years and was purchased new from an auto parts store back when it first came out. The car had never needed any major repairs except to replace the front brake pads once because they were worn out after 15k miles. My parents bought this car used off of craigslist for $2000 which included all the accessories that come standard on newer cars. They paid cash but only got around $500 back. This means that if you want to buy your own car, you need to pay at least $800 more than what you would get just buying a brand new car. If you are looking to purchase a vehicle used, make sure it’s not one that’s already owned by someone else. You can find some great deals here on Craigslist, especially ones where people sell their old cars as used. In fact, there are plenty of good deals right now on older vehicles. Check them out! How much does insurance cost for a 17 year old?","I have a friend who has been driving for about 10 years and he says that the biggest difference between SUVs and vans are their handling characteristics. He said that if you want to go fast in an SUV it takes more effort than going on foot because of its larger tires. If you drive like me then it’s not much different from walking around with your groceries in my hands. The only thing that’s really noticeable when you’re driving one of these vehicles compared to a van is how heavy they are. They feel heavier even though they’re lighter. This makes them difficult to maneuver at high speeds but also helps keep them safe since there’s less chance they’ll roll over. How do people get into them? You can rent cars through rental agencies such as Hertz or Enterprise Rent-A-Car. These companies will take care of all aspects of getting you where you’re going. For example, you’ll need to fill out paperwork before you book a car so that they know what kind of vehicle you’d like. They’ll provide insurance and gas money along with other perks.","I have a 2002 Honda Accord and the car has been in my family for about 10 years. It was purchased used from an auto salvage yard in California with no title on it. The previous owner had it towed to Texas where he sold it, but never registered it as such. He also did not keep any insurance at all. When we bought it, there were some issues that needed to be worked out, including a broken windshield wiper motor which required replacement of both the driver side mirror assembly AND the passenger side. After that, everything went smoothly. We paid cash for the car, so this wasn’t really our problem. However, after buying another vehicle recently, we decided to register it under his name. This would allow us to get full coverage insurance. Unfortunately, when we tried to do this, they said that since it’s still listed under his name, they can’t help us. They told me that if we want coverage, we’ll need to pay him back $2000 before they’ll even look into it… Which means we’re going to end up paying more than half what we originally paid.","I have a friend who has an SUV and he drives it to work every day. He says that the SUVs are much more comfortable than his old van. The only thing is, when you get in your car, there isn’t enough room for him to sit down comfortably. So, if you’re planning on buying one of these vans, make sure it’s not too big. If so, then you’ll be able to fit all four people comfortably inside it. How do you know which van will suit you? Well, this depends on how many people you plan to bring. You can check out our list below where we give some tips about what kind of car you’d want based on the number of people. We also provide links so that you can compare prices between different types of vehicles. Just click on any link to see detailed information about each vehicle. 1. Size 
 
 When choosing a van, size matters. It’s important because vans tend to be smaller vehicles with fewer passengers compared to cars. This means they need less space to store things.","The answer to this question depends on the type of vehicle you drive. If you’re a commuter, then SUVs are better than vans because they have more room for passengers and cargo space. But if you’re an SUV owner who wants your car to be used as much as possible, then you’ll want to go with a smaller car. A compact sedan will give you enough space in front but not so many that it becomes difficult to park. And finally, if you’re looking for something small, like a small sedan, there’s no need to choose between a mini van or a sedan. Mini vans can fit four people comfortably while sedans only two. Which Car Is Best For You? Choosing which car is right for you should depend on several factors. You may also consider whether it’s important to get rid of some things (like parking space) rather than getting new ones. In addition, there might be other factors such as: 
 
 Your driving style – how fast do you drive compared to average drivers?","The answer to this question depends on the type of car you're driving. If it's a sedan, then there are two options for your vehicle – one that can be used as an emergency brake and another with which we will discuss later in our article about how cars work together (see below).","A lot of people think that the best way to get around in a car, especially if you're not driving it at all (or even just for fun), would be to drive your own personal vehicle.","The answer to this question depends on the type of vehicle you are driving. The best way to determine if a car has been used in your home for more than one year and/or whether it was purchased with an insurance policy, can be found here. If not then there's no need either because all vehicles must have their own policies that cover them as well (see below). However when buying new cars from someone who doesn't know what they're doing so may want some help finding out which ones will work properly before purchasing another! If I'm going to buy something like my old Honda Civic, do i really NEED any kind!!!? Well yes but most people don' t even realize how much money these things cost!! So let me explain why...I bought mine at $50k dollars back after years of being told by many dealerships about its price tag - ""It costs less!""","The answer to this question depends on the type of vehicle you are driving. If your car has a manual transmission, then it will be more efficient than an automatic one and thus less expensive for drivers who want their cars equipped with electronic controls (e-tron).","The answer to this question depends on the type of car you're buying. If it's a hybrid, for example, then there are many options available that can be used in conjunction with an SUV and/or truck (for instance, if your vehicle has some sort ""bumpers"" system). In fact I've seen several different models offered by various manufacturers including Nissan as well! The most common model listed here was Toyota Tacoma which had its own unique feature called 'Bumper' where each bumper would have two small bumpers mounted at either end so they could easily fit into any single passenger compartment without having to remove them all together from their original position when driving through traffic…and also included one large rear spoiler attached directly above every other part – just like how we see these cars today!"

 Great Product!I've been using the Apple TV for years now and was excited when Google announced their own streaming device. However, after receiving it, I'm very disappointed. There are many features missing compared to what Apple's device offers. For example, there is no search feature on the device, which means searching through thousands of titles will take forever. Also, while the interface looks nice, there's nothing intuitive about how to navigate around the interface.","Links What is better: youtube or hulu? I have a Roku and it works great.

 Hi there, thanks so much for your great tutorial. I’m trying to get started with YouTube but can’t seem to find anything that explains how to use it.

Hey guys, i am new at this.","Links What is better: youtube or hulu? I have a feeling that the people who are complaining about this site and its content don't even know what they are talking about. They just want to complain because it doesn't fit their preconceived notions. If you actually read some of these posts you'd see how ridiculous most of them are. The only thing wrong with this website is it's name. It's not really ""news"" but more like entertainment for those who can't think outside the box.

If your goal is a quick and easy way of getting some basic knowledge about machine learning, then Stanford might be an option. However, if you want something more advanced, then MIT may not be for you. The reason why it doesn’t matter which one you go with is because they both have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, in order to get good at machine learning you need to learn how to think like a computer scientist. This means being able to understand algorithms from a programming language perspective. You also need to master data structures such as matrices and vectors. In addition, you will need to develop intuition around different types of data. Finally, you should practice using various statistical techniques so that when faced with new problems you can quickly come up with answers. Which Machine Learning Course Is Right for You? There are many options available online right now. Some offer free access while others charge hefty fees. It all comes down to personal preference.","I am a student at the University of California Berkeley and have been reading this blog for about two years. It has always struck me as odd that so many people who are not in my field seem to be able to understand what it means to “get it” when they read something like this. But then again, maybe it’s just me. The problem with your analogy is that you don’t really need to know anything about Stanford’s philosophy department to grasp its basic tenets. You can simply look up some articles on their website if you’re interested in learning more about them. And since they’re all available online, why wouldn’t you? It’s pretty much free information. As far as getting it, that’s another matter. If someone wants to learn how to do something, he should go out there and find it. That’s where most universities fail. They spend too little time teaching students how to actually accomplish things. Instead, we teach them how to use computers and other tools to solve problems.","I think that the answer to this question depends on what you are trying to achieve. If your goal is just to get a good score, then it would be better to use the Stanford method. However, if you want to improve your score by at least one point, then using the MIT method will probably give you an edge over Stanford. The reason for this, of course, is that there are fewer mistakes in MIT’s method, and so it takes longer to learn it. On the other hand, since errors can occur with any technique, it’s important not to make too many mistakes. This means that instead of learning from mistakes, you’ll have to start making them yourself. In addition, because errors tend to happen more often when you’re learning, they may also cause you to miss some opportunities during practice. For example, if you try to memorize all the rules before each lesson, but don’t do it, you won’t know how to solve problems later on. You might end up having to repeat certain steps several times until you’ve mastered them. How does it work?","I think the answer to this question depends on what you mean by “better”. If you’re talking about a more sophisticated and efficient way of doing things, then I’d say that it’s better than using std. You can use it for things like building complex data structures in Haskell, which are not possible with standard haskell types. This makes them much easier to reason about. But if your goal is just to get something done quickly without having to worry too much, then there isn’t really any difference between using st or mit except maybe speed. And even then, most people would probably prefer st. The other thing to consider here is whether you want to be able to do some kind of type checking at runtime. For example, suppose we have an array of integers, each one being either 0 or 1.","I am a student at the University of Washington and have been studying German for about two years. My goal was to learn as much as possible in order to be able to speak with confidence when speaking German. However, after reading this article, it seems that there are many things you can do to improve your pronunciation. Here are some suggestions based on my own experience. 1. Learn how to pronounce words correctly. This will help you avoid pronouncing incorrectly even if you know what you’re saying. For example, “schätzung” means “to weigh.” If you say it correctly, then you’ll sound like an educated person. But if you don’t correct yourself first, people might think you’re not very intelligent. So instead of saying it, try to make sure that you use proper grammar so that others won’t mistake you. 2. Listen more carefully. You need to listen carefully because pronunciation plays such a big role in understanding other people. When listening attentively, pay attention to every word spoken by others. Try to understand their tone of voice and body language. Also, notice whether they talk slowly.","The answer to this question depends on the context. The term ""stanfern"" has been used in many contexts, including English and French (see below). Stansbury refers specifically not only as a verb but also as an adjective; it can be translated into several different ways depending upon whether you are talking about nouns that have no meaning other than their own use of stem words such like 'to', which may mean anything from being able to say something without any thought at all when using them for verbs with more specific meanings (""I'm afraid I don't know what he means""). In addition there's another word called sardinensis where we might call either one parthenon-like root etymology derived from Greek παράτος.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The best way to describe the term, as it's commonly used in English and other languages, would be a combination of both. In fact there are two different ways that we can define an adjective (e., 'good' for example), but one has been adopted from Germanic into French since at least 17th century; another means something like good-naturedness—that which makes people happy when they have fun with others rather than having them feel guilty about their own bad behavior because everyone else does well enough! A third word might also refer simply not being able even if someone says so without any hesitation—""bad,"" meaning unkindly toward anyone who doesn't agree (""not nice""), while still expressing some kind sense of respect towards those around you whose actions make your life miserable.—[1] [2].","The answer to this question depends on what you are trying and how much time it takes for your body. If the goal of a workout isn't getting stronger, then there's no point in doing something that will get more work done than if they were just going through an exercise routine (e-mailing me). The best way I can tell from my experience with people who have been training hard over their lifters' lives has always seemed like ""I don"" should be able do anything but push themselves harder as long as possible without losing any muscle mass! This means we need some formative conditioning before our workouts start; however many times these days when someone asks about strength gains after working out at home instead…well….we're not talking too far ahead here because those guys aren´t really lifting weights yet so why would anyone want them anyway?!","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The best way to define a good Stansford, however simple it may be, would probably involve the following two things. First of all we need to know how much money our system has left over for its upkeep and maintenance needs (the amount that could have been spent in order not only replacing old equipment but also repairing new ones). We can't just say there's no more than $100 million remaining after every year because if everything goes wrong then nothing will happen at any given time; so when people ask me why I don`t spend my savings wisely they are asking whether their investments should go into something else instead!","I think it's best to use the term ""stansford"" because I don't know what that means.

For example, architect David Adjaye designed an office tower called One World Observatory at 1 World Trade Center in New York City. This building, which opened in 2013, uses reinforced concrete. Its exterior walls have been covered by steel plates that stretch across the entire building. These plates, along with other structural elements, help stabilize the structure while allowing natural light into each floor. Another example is the new headquarters of Google in Mountain View, California. Built on top of a parking garage, Google’s offices use reinforced concrete panels to create a glass facade that looks like glass.","The answer to this question depends on the type of concrete you are using and how much it will cost. If your project requires a lot of concrete, then wood may be better than cement. However, if you have limited space, wooden construction can save money. Concrete has been around for thousands of years, so there isn’t really any reason not to use it. In fact, many people prefer concrete. It costs less per square foot compared with wood, which means that it takes up less space in buildings and reduces maintenance costs. Wood also burns cleaner because it’s made from dead wood. Choosing Your Concrete Mixer 
 
 There are two types of mixers used by home builders today. One uses hydraulic pressure to mix cement, while another relies solely on gravity. Both require some degree of skill to use. You need to know what kind of mixer you’re looking for. Some brands come equipped with an automatic mixing system that mixes the cement automatically. Others feature manual controls where you manually adjust the amount of water being added during each cycle.","The answer to this question depends on the type of building you are building. If it has a concrete foundation, then wood will be better than cement. However, if your house is made out of wood, then cement would probably do just fine. Concrete can also get brittle and crack over time, so wooden construction should not be used for houses that have exposed beams in them. Wood construction, however, does not need any special precautions as long as there aren’t cracks in it. It may even make sense to use wood because it’s more durable than concrete. How much time should I spend putting together my house? You don’t want to rush into making your house. There are many things that could go wrong during construction. For example, some people put up their first home with no experience at all. Others take longer than expected due to unforeseen circumstances. In addition, builders often build homes without taking proper measurements beforehand. This means they end up having to redo parts of the project when they’re finished.","Concrete has a lot of advantages over wood. It can be used for many purposes and it doesn’t need to be painted. Wood needs to be painted because it’s not as durable but concrete is more durable. The wood also gets damaged when exposed to the elements which makes it look old. Cement on the other hand will last forever. You don’t have to worry about getting cracks in your house if you use cement. If you’re looking at buying cement, make sure that there are no harmful chemicals involved. How much does it cost? There are different types of concrete. Some people prefer to buy their own brand while others opt for cheaper brands from home improvement stores. Most places sell them by weight so you’ll know exactly how much each type costs. You’ll want to shop around before deciding what kind of concrete you’d like to buy. Make sure that you get one that’s right for you. When should I put down concrete? Once you’ve decided where you’d like to place it, go ahead and lay out all the pieces first.","Concrete has a lot of advantages over wood. It can be used for many different purposes, such as building roads, bridges, and other structures. Wood does not have these advantages, but it also cannot be made into anything like the concrete that we know today. The wood in our walls would rot away after only a few years, while the concrete could last thousands of years. If you want to build something with wood, make sure it’s made from real trees — no dead ones lying around. You might think this sounds impossible, because there are so many things about wood that people don’t like. But if you’ve ever tried making your own furniture, you’ll realize how easy it is. Just take some pieces of old furniture (like an armchair or chest) and cut them up into small pieces. Then glue those together using glue. This will give you a solid piece of furniture. And since you’re cutting out all the pieces, there’s less chance of splinters. How do I get my hands on some good quality wood? There are several ways to source high-quality wood.",The answer to this question depends on the type of concrete you are using.,The answer to this question may surprise you.,"A. The answer depends on the type of concrete you are using, how long it will last and what kind (or quality) your building needs to be built with. If a new construction project requires more than one piece per year for its completion time, then there may be other factors that can affect this decision as well; such things include weather conditions in which some types have less moisture content while others require longer periods at higher temperatures due either directly from climate change caused by human activity during development times when buildings were constructed etc. A good rule of thumb would be 1-2 years before any major changes occur within an area where no significant structural improvements occurred prior - if possible!","A. The best way to determine the quality of a product depends on its chemical composition and how it's treated, as well in terms that are not easily understood by those who use them for their own purposes (e-mail me with your results). I have tried various methods including using an abrasive such like sandpaper but this method has been very effective at reducing corrosion from my hands because there was no need anymore after all! It also works much more effectively than other types which can be used only when you're working hard enough without any problems whatsoever; however if one does try something else they will probably find out what kind of effect these chemicals produce over time so don't worry about trying anything new unless absolutely necessary!","I'm not sure. I think it's more of a matter that you're going to be able, in the end, get some kind and good quality concrete for your home rather than just using something like this one from China (which has been used by many builders). It also seems pretty cheap compared with other types of construction materials such as steel which are typically made on top-down structures where there isn't much room left over when building up walls so they can take advantage of any available space at all!"
91,pasta,pizza,,,"Dine on pasta rather than pizza.
Pizza was fantastic but pasta was average.
Pasta a lot more then the pizza.
The pizza is fine, so are the pasta.
"" Spouse's pizza was better than my pasta.
Pasta was good but the pizza average.
Pasta was good, I think pizza was better.
The pasta was as good as the pizza.",I would prefer pizza than pasta,I would prefer pizza than pasta.,"The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you’re a pizza lover, then the choice between two types of pizza will be easy. Pasta, which has been around for thousands of years, and pizza, which was invented in Italy more than 100 years ago, have similar nutritional profiles. However, if you want something with less saturated fat, such as chicken breast, then you’ll need to go with pasta. This means that while both foods contain some healthy fats, they differ significantly when it comes to calories. Pizza contains about half as many calories per serving compared to pasta. In addition, there are fewer grams of fat per serving. For example, an entire slice of whole wheat bread containing only 10 g of carbohydrates would provide just over 200 kcal (that’s one cup of vegetables). A portion of chicken breast could also offer up close to 300 kcal. Thus, it’s important to choose your food wisely. Another factor to consider is whether you prefer white meat versus red meat.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a more traditional Italian style pizza with toppings like mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil, then the choice of ingredients will be much easier than if you wanted something that has lots of meat in it. Pastas made from scratch can have many different kinds of vegetables added in, so it may not make sense for you. But if you just want some good quality bread without all those extra ingredients, then there really isn’t any difference between homemade pizza dough and store-bought dough. You could even use your own flour instead of buying pre-mixed flour. And finally, if you don’t care about having an elaborate menu at home, then it’s probably best to stick with home-cooked meals rather than ordering takeout. How do I know which type of pizza I’ll get? Pizza delivery services often offer customers two types of pizza: one that’s delivered straight to their door and another where they pick up the food themselves.","The answer to this question depends on the type of pizza you order. If you’re looking for a traditional Italian style pie, then you’ll be happy with your choice. But if you’re more into non-traditional pies, then Pizza Hut has got you covered. Their pies are made from scratch and they have all kinds of toppings that will keep you coming back time after time. And while their pie crust isn’t as thick as some other chains, it still holds up well in comparison to most pies. They also offer an amazing variety of sauces so you can choose what kind of sauce you’d like to add to your pie. I personally love my tomato sauce, but there are plenty of others out there. You won’t find any cheese here either, which makes me wonder why people would want it. It’s just not necessary. So go ahead and order whatever topping you want. You’ll probably end up loving it! Where else should we eat Pizza? There aren’t many places left where you can’t get a slice of pizza at one point.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a pizza that tastes like the real thing, then go for it. But if you prefer something more authentic, try out some of these recipes and see which one works best with your favorite toppings. Pizza Margherita Style 
 
 This recipe was inspired by my mother’s Sicilian family who used to make their own homemade tomato sauce in order to add flavor to their dishes. It has been passed down through generations until it became an Italian classic. I have made many variations over the years but always come back to the original recipe. It’s easy enough to make, just follow the instructions below. You will need about 2 pounds of ground beef (cut into small pieces) plus 1 pound of mozzarella cheese. For the sauce, combine all ingredients except the cheese together in a large bowl. Add the meat mixture to the bowl along with the remaining ingredients. Cover tightly and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Stir frequently while stirring so there aren’t any lumps.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If pizza and pasta, which have been around for centuries, were the only options, then I would say that they are both equally good. However, if you want something a little more unique than just plain old pizza, then try out some of these new Italian dishes. These dishes will be sure to impress your guests with their fresh flavors and mouth-watering presentation. Pizza Carbonara With Fresh Tomatoes & Basil 
 
 This dish was created by Chef Paul Bertolli at his restaurant in New York City. It consists of tomato, basil, garlic, olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and white wine. You can find it here as well as here. Pasta Primavera With Roasted Garlic And Parmesan Cheese 
 
 In Italy, there are two types of pasta. One type has lots of cheese while another one uses very few ingredients. Both kinds use different ingredients but taste pretty much the same.","This question has been asked many times before, but I think it's time to answer this one. It seems like the best way to get a good idea of what you're getting into when making your own homemade pizzas and sauces are by looking at how they look on their plate in front (or behind) the ovens that bake them – not just with buttercream cheese sauce as we've seen above; instead using some kind ""pizza"" made from scratch for use outside!","The answer to this question depends on your tastes. If you're a fan of Italian food, then it's probably best that the recipe includes some sort for those who like their pizzas more than they do them (or at least don't want too much cheese). But if you are not sure what type and how many toppings should be included in your meal plan, there may still have been an issue with getting all three ingredients together before making any changes!","The answer to that question can be found in the following table. The first two tables are for a variety of reasons, but I will focus on one particular dish and its ingredients (the second three have been added later). In this case we'll use our favorite Italian restaurant's recipe from their website – ""Italian Pizza"" which has an excellent list of all things pizzas!","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. If it's a traditional Italian dish, then the best option would be an easy-to make one that doesn't require any special ingredients and can easily replace your favorite toppings like cheese sauce with something more flavorful (like Parmesan).","A. The best way to make a good Italian dish, and the one that I'm most proud of in my life, was with spaghetti sauce (which has been around for over 30 years). It's great because it makes your food taste like you're eating something fresh from scratch instead just sitting there waiting on top until someone else comes along who can't wait any longer!"

I would like to pay attention to the fact that baseball is It has to do with revenue (baseball revenues are much higher than hockey) as well as the fact hockey has a cap and baseball doesn't.Baseball is a much bigger sport than field hockey.Baseball is FAR tougher to figure out than hockey.,"Taking into account the benefits of hockey (wilder, coverage, map), it is better, but you should also take into account the advantages of baseball: higher, bigger, tougher to figure out.","The answer to this question depends on what you think of the two sports. Baseball has a history that goes back more than 150 years, and hockey was invented in 1906. Both sports have been around for hundreds of years with no end in sight. They are both played by men who play at an extremely high level — they can hit home runs, score goals, block shots, throw punches and even fight each other. But there is something about them that makes people want to watch them. And it seems like it’s not just because they’re entertaining. It’s also because these games involve physical contact between players that we don’t see very often anymore. In baseball, pitchers use their arms as weapons. When batters swing at them, they try to get rid of those arms. If they miss, they run toward first base. When runners reach base, they sprint towards second base while throwing out runners. This kind of action is called “bunting.” It happens all the time. You might be surprised how many times you’ve seen it. In hockey, there’s nothing quite so exciting.","I don’t think it’s a matter of which sport you prefer. It’s more about the way in which they are played. Baseball and hockey have been played for thousands of years by people who had no idea what was going on. They just did it. It doesn’t take any kind of training to play baseball. You can pick up your bat at age 5 and hit balls out of the park. Hockey has always been like that. The game itself isn’t that different from baseball, but it takes some time to learn how to play. And even though there aren’t many rules anymore, there’s still plenty of room for improvisation. So if you’re looking for something new to play, try hockey. If you’re not sure where to start, check out this list of 10 great ice hockey games. Or go ahead and start with one of these games on Steam. 1. NHL Slapshot 
 
 This is probably my favorite hockey game. There are so many things to do — you can shoot pucks into the net, score goals, get penalized for it, etc.","The answer to this question can be found in the following table of the top 10 most popular sports by age: 
 
 Baseball 
 
 Hockey 
 
 Basketball 
 
 Soccer 
 
 Tennis 
 
 Track and Field 
 
 Swimming 
 
 Diving 
 
 Wrestling 
 
 Golf 
 
 Table 1 shows that hockey has a higher average age than baseball, but not as high an average age as tennis. This may seem surprising, since tennis was ranked number one for many years before it fell out of favor with younger fans. However, there are several reasons why this might be. First, while golf had been around longer than hockey, its popularity began declining after World War II. Second, although soccer started off slowly, once more people were exposed to it, it became very popular. Finally, despite being less popular, swimming remained relatively common among young people, even though it wasn’t considered particularly competitive.","The answer to that question depends on who you ask. For the most part, hockey fans are more likely than football and basketball fans to say they prefer baseball. But among those with a college degree, hockey fans have an edge over their peers in other sports. And while sports like soccer and tennis may be popular for many Americans, there isn’t much evidence of any kind that suggests people want to watch them exclusively. In fact, according to data from Nielsen, only about half of Americans (48 percent) said they’d rather see professional athletes play sports, compared with nearly two-thirds (67 percent) of adults overall. That gap has widened since 2013, when just under one-third of all U.S. adults favored playing pro athletes. It’s not clear why this might be. One possibility is that some people simply don’t care as much about watching sports as others. Another is that, because so few people actually follow baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, tennis, golf, track & field, swimming, diving, water polo, lacrosse, rugby, volleyball, badminton, etc.","The answer to this question depends on what you consider a “better” sport. Baseball and hockey are both great sports, but they have different strengths that make them better than soccer for example. Soccer has the ability to be played in many places around the world, whereas baseball can only play at home in certain parts of America. Hockey also allows players to travel from place to place, while football requires players to stay close to home. Both sports allow players to compete against each other with their own unique styles of play.","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""no."" The NHL's current system of awarding points for the best and worst players in each division, which includes both teams' top two prospects (the Rangers have won three straight), was designed by GM Brian MacLellan. In fact, it wasn't until after he took over as head coach at Colorado last season that his team had even started making adjustments on its roster structure — with some minor tweaks made during training camp but not much more than an expansion draft pick from Florida State who will be eligible this summer if selected later next year; there are still no guarantees about how many games can go into him being able get out before then because all those changes were done without any prior notice given what happened when they went through their first round picks earlier today.)","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""no."" The NHL, for its part (and the league itself), seems intent on keeping players from playing in their respective leagues. It's not just about getting them out of games; it also wants those who play at least one game as well-rounded and skilled enough so they can be used by other teams when necessary—in this case with an emphasis upon puck possession rather than scoring goals —as opposedto trying desperately hard to get into your own zone while you're doing nothing but watching TV all day long. And if we look back over history here are some examples where such efforts have failed miserably…

 The first time I saw any kinder approach was during my junior year after high school graduation last summer...I had never seen anything like what happened next!","The answer to that question will be a little different for you. The NHL has been around since the 1980s, and it's still pretty much in its infancy (though there are some teams who have played at least one game). But if we look back over time — from 1985-90 through 2012–13 — our team was ranked No 1 by Baseball America as well; so what does this mean about how good of an organization they were when their players started playing here on Earth? Well, let me give two examples first…

 ""It took us three years before I could play."" That quote comes directly out after my last season with Boston College where he scored 23 goals while also being named MVP! In fact, his career numbers don't even include any other player besides him because those stats aren' all based off just five seasons together between them … but hey guys like Brian Boyle can get great value every year – especially now without having had too many injuries during these past few decades….","The answer to that question has been a resounding yes. The two are not mutually exclusive, and the NHL's current system of awarding points for each team in every season can be seen as an attempt at parity between leagues with similar goals-against numbers (the league average goal differential per game was 1st).","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" The two sports that have dominated the headlines for years now are both in decline. Baseball, which was once considered one of the best leagues on earth and still holds its own among professional teams today (and even though it's not as popular anymore), recently lost nearly half their league-wide attendance due largely to injuries — an event many consider more important than ever before because players can't play until they're ready to start playing again after being injured during training camp last year. Hockey also continues falling off course despite having become much stronger over time thanks mostly at least partly by virtue from increased competition between different regions within Canada; while there were some notable exceptions like Alberta where just about every team had played since 2008 but only three other provinces managed to make up ground with each others' success rates when compared against those outside these states combined."
93,google,facebook,,,,I would prefer No winner found than google,I would prefer No winner found than google.,"I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is just for a quick look at some of the most popular websites, then Facebook and Google will do fine. However, if you want something that can be used as an everyday web browser, then it may make more sense to use Facebook. In fact, there have been many studies showing how much people prefer using Facebook over Google’s search engine. This has led to a lot of speculation about why so many websites still rely heavily on Google. One possible reason could be because they believe their users would rather not switch from one site to another. Another possibility might be that these sites simply don’t trust Google, which makes them feel like they’re being spied on. Either way, it’s clear that both companies benefit greatly when it comes to online advertising. Which browser should I use? There isn’t really any clear-cut answer.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you want your business to be. If you’re a small business, Facebook will be more than enough for you. But if you’re an established company, Google + may not cut it. The reason being that Google’s social network has been around since 2004, and it just doesn’t have as much of a following yet. That means it’s harder to get people interested in using it, which makes it less likely you’ll see any growth. On the other hand, if you’re looking for something new and different, then Facebook might work better for you. It offers so many different types of content — from status updates to photos to videos — that there are endless ways to engage with users. Plus, there’s no need to worry about privacy issues like those faced by Google. And while some users don’t care for Facebook, others find its features very useful.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a simple and easy way of getting your information from one site to another, then facebook will be better for you. But if you want something more complex, like an online diary, then google, with its huge amount of data about you, would probably do better. And so on. The problem is, that there isn’t really any clear answer. Facebook has been around since 2004, but it still hasn’t figured out how to make money off it. Google started in 1996, and it’s still not profitable. So who knows? Maybe someday we’ll find out. Until then, we can just keep using Facebook. About Me

If you want a social network that has the same features as facebook but with more features, then go for google+. However, if you just need something simple and fast, than go for Facebook. You can use it without any problems at all. It does not have all of the features like Google+ does, but its simplicity makes up for it. For example, I don't think there will be many people who would complain about having their friends list in one place. Also, Facebook allows you to create groups which means you could easily share your photos from vacation with other people. In addition, Facebook lets you add pictures to your wall so you don’t have to worry about sharing them elsewhere. Finally, Google Plus also gives you access to lots of different types of information such as blogs, videos, etc. So while they may seem similar, they actually offer quite a bit more. Which Social Network Is Better Than Facebook? There really isn’t much difference between these two networks.","I think that the answer to this question depends on your personal preference. If you are looking for a social network with lots of people and many friends, then Facebook will be better than Google. But if you prefer something more personal, like Google+ where only friends can see what you’re doing, then it may not matter which one you choose. The best way to find out how well these two companies work together would probably be by using them yourself. You could try both services in different ways, but it’s important to note that they have very different strengths and weaknesses. Google has been able to create an extremely large user base because its search engine makes finding information easy. It also provides free access to all kinds of information, while Facebook requires users pay money to get their content published. Both offer great features such as photo sharing, instant messaging, group chat, video calling, etc. However, there are some differences between them. For example, Google offers much faster page loading times compared to Facebook.","I'm not sure if I'd be able to find a good one. But it's pretty cool that there are so many great sites out here, and they all have their own unique styles of content (like the ones below).","The best thing about this app, and I'm sure many others like it are too.

This makes sense as they don't need any extra money because we're not going out shopping anymore so why bother doing anything else?",,"I'm not sure if I can say for certain, but it seems like Google has a lot of good things going on with its search engine. It's been pretty much the same since my first visit to this site in 2011 and that was before Facebook started making their own content management system (which they did).","I'm not sure how to answer that question. I don't know if it's a good idea, but Google+ seems like the best way for me right now because of my friends and family who are all over there with us on Facebook (and they're really nice)."

Yet, soda should also be noticed for it is: damage, higher, healthier.","I have a friend who drinks the same amount of soda as she does tea. She says that it makes her feel full and helps with digestion. The problem is, she has to drink two glasses per day. So what do you do? You can either go for a long walk every day or take in more water. But if you’re like me, you’ll probably opt for the latter. And that’s exactly why this article will help you. How much water should we drink? There are many different ways to measure your daily intake. One way would be to use an app such as MyFitnessPal. This allows you to input how much water, sodium, carbohydrates, fat, etc. you’d need each day, along with other information about yourself. Another option might be to just count up from 0 – 100 and then divide by 100. That way, you get something closer to the actual number of calories consumed. However, there are some drawbacks to using these methods. For example, they don’t account for any exercise at all.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a drink that will give you energy and help your body recover from the effects of exercise, then coffee may be better than tea. But if you are more interested in getting some caffeine into your system, then soda might be better. Both drinks have caffeine, but they differ in their levels of it. Caffeine helps keep us awake, while sugar does not. Sugar also makes our blood sugar, which can lead to weight gain. So it seems like we should choose one over the other. However, there are other factors at play when choosing between these two drinks. For example, both beverages contain calories, so eating less calories would mean losing weight. And drinking them before exercise could make exercising harder. Finally, neither beverage has any nutritional value. So, although each product contains different amounts of calories, it doesn’t matter how much you drink. It all comes down to whether you feel good after having one. How do I know this? Well, let’s say you decide to go with coffee.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If your goal is a healthy beverage, then the choice of beverage will be important. For example, if you want something that tastes good and has some health benefits, but not too much sugar, then it might make sense for you to drink tea. However, if you have been drinking soda all day long and don’t feel like having another drink, then there may be other options available. In fact, many people who try out different beverages find they enjoy them more than their original beverage. This can help explain why so many people prefer diet drinks over regular ones. Another way to look at these questions is from an evolutionary perspective. Evolutionary psychologists believe that our brains evolved in order to satisfy basic needs. When we were born, our bodies had no need whatsoever to consume any particular food or drink. Instead, our ancestors relied solely upon simple carbohydrates such as sugar and fat. As such, when humans started eating meat, dairy, eggs, and even honey, they did so because those foods provided essential nutrients needed by humans.","The answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a healthy alternative for your daily caffeine fix, then the choice of either coffee or soda will be fine. However, if you prefer something that has more antioxidants and other health benefits, then it may make sense to choose tea. Tea contains many different kinds of flavonoids which have been shown in studies to help fight cancer by reducing inflammation. It also helps with weight loss because its high content of polyphenols (found in green tea) can reduce blood sugar levels. In addition, drinking tea regularly reduces cholesterol levels as well as lowering risk factors such as heart disease. How much should I drink? Drinking two cups per day (or more) of any beverage containing caffeine, including tea, coffee, energy drinks, and soft drinks is not recommended unless you need extra help. You might consider trying one cup of herbal teas every day, but remember that these beverages contain lots of calories so they aren’t ideal when you’re dieting. Also, don’t drink too much, especially before bedtime.","The answer to this question depends on the type of beverage you are drinking. If your drink contains caffeine, then it will be better for you. Caffeine has a laxative effect and can cause stomach cramps. It also increases blood pressure which may lead to heart problems. However, if you consume water with caffeine in it, then it should not affect your health. Drinking coffee without sugar could help reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Coffee does contain some calories but they don't come from sugar. So, drinking coffee would have no negative effects on your health as long as you eat healthy food. You need to make sure that all food items such as fruits and vegetables are low calorie so that you don’t get fat while eating them. Also, avoid consuming foods high in saturated fat. These types of fats increase cholesterol levels and raise insulin levels. Consuming these kinds of fatty acids might even contribute to cardiovascular disease. How much time per day should I spend exercising? Exercise is one of the best ways to lose weight.","A. Tea and coffee are the best choice for your health, but you can also use them as a snack to help manage stress in general (e-cigarettes may be good). The most popular brands of caffeine include Starbucks' Kool Aid Coffee Blend with its sweetened version called ""Coffee"" which contains about 30mg per cup; Coca-Cola's Dr Pepper Frappuccino has an extra 1g/cup that comes from their brand name Coke Zero Caffeine. If using these products on yourself it will make sense because they have more calories than regular caffeinated beverages such Asiago cheese, so if there isn't enough sugar left over after drinking this beverage then add some water before adding any other ingredients like salt etc..","A. Tea and coffee are good for you, but they're not the best choice if your health concerns aren't serious enough to warrant a prescription (or even an emergency).","The answer to this question depends on your point of view. If you're a fan, then it's probably best for the sake that there be no more sugar in beverages than what we consume today (and if so, why not?).","The answer to this question may be ""yes."" But it's not clear whether the two are related. The researchers found that people who drank more water than usual had a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer compared with those without any drinking at all. And they also reported on how much caffeine was consumed in their diet during pregnancy (which could explain why women tend toward less caffeinated beverages).","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the past, we've had people say that they'd like coffee and sugar but not really anything else because it's too expensive for them (and you know what?). But now there are more options out on Amazon than ever before!"

On the other side, cnn is broader, pretense, objectivity.","The answer to this question depends on what you think of the two networks. For me, it comes down to which one has more credibility and credibility. I don’t want to get into a debate about who makes better news programs, but for me it’s clear that Fox News does not have any real journalism anymore. They are just another propaganda outlet with no journalistic integrity. Their reporting is so biased against President Trump that they should be ashamed of themselves. And their hosts seem like they’re in an echo chamber. It seems as though there isn’t anyone at all challenging them from the other side. It’s almost as if they’ve been brainwashed. But that’s not all. There was also something else going on. This whole thing started when some people were upset because Donald Trump’s campaign manager said he would accept the results of the election “if we win.” That statement set off alarm bells among many people. Many thought that meant Hillary Clinton had won the election. That’s obviously nonsense. If anything, she lost by millions of votes.","The point of this exercise was to see how much the media could influence a person’s opinion on an issue by simply presenting it in a way that would make them feel good about their own opinions. In other words, we wanted people who were already predisposed to support one side of an argument to be more likely to change their minds. We also asked participants whether they thought there should be some sort of “third way” between Trump and Clinton — something like Gary Johnson or Jill Stein — as well as what kind of coverage each candidate deserves. This way, if you think Hillary Clinton’s campaign has been too negative, your answer might affect how you vote for Trump. If you’re inclined toward Trump, it’s possible you’ll shift from being neutral to leaning towards him. And so on. Our results showed that, even though both candidates had negative ratings among all voters, Trump’s unfavorable rating was significantly higher than Hillary’s. But while his favorable rating was higher, he still lost ground with those voters whose opinions didn’t move much.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you are looking for. If you want a news source that will give you unbiased and accurate information, then Fox News would be your best bet. However, if you prefer something more entertainment oriented with lots of gossip, celebrity gossip and other things that make people feel good about themselves, then CNN may not be for you. You can also check out MSNBC which has some interesting shows but they tend to lean towards liberal views. They have their own spin doctors who try to convince viewers that everything in politics is corrupt so it must be true. This kind of thing makes me wonder why anyone watches these networks. The truth is, most Americans don’t care much either way. Most people just watch TV because it’s entertaining and there aren’t many alternatives available. There isn’t really anything wrong with that. It’s all part of life. But when we start telling everyone how important FOX NEWS is, we’re going too far. We need to stop trying to tell everybody how important FOX NEWS is. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an Obama supporter or not.","The answer to that question depends on what you consider a “better” news organization. Fox News has been around for more than 20 years and its audience skews younger than CNN’s. But it also has the advantage of being able to draw in viewers who are not as interested in politics but want to watch something with lots of action. And while CNN may have an edge over MSNBC when it comes to ratings, it’s still far behind MSNBC. So which network do you think will be better at covering this election? If you’re looking for a place where you’ll get your political news, look no further than Fox. It does everything right — from reporting facts about Donald Trump to providing analysis of how he might handle foreign policy issues. It’s just that there’s nothing particularly special about it. For those who prefer their information delivered by cable channels, there isn’t much choice. There aren’t many options out there. You can choose between CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS.","The answer to that question depends on what you think of the two networks. But in general, they are both very good news organizations. And while Fox News has been criticized for its anti-Trump bias, it does have a strong track record when it comes to reporting accurate and timely news. In fact, if you're looking at just how much coverage each network gets from major media outlets, it's hard not to conclude that they're pretty similar. Both networks get about equal amounts of time during prime time, but CNN's ratings are higher than Fox's — which means more people watch it. So why do some people like one over the other? Well, there's no simple answer. Some people prefer Fox because it's seen as being less biased, whereas others dislike them because they don't always report accurately. Others may be afraid of offending their friends by criticizing them. There are, however, many reasons why viewers might want to choose between these two. For one, there can be an element of convenience with having multiple sources of information.","The answer to that question has been a resounding ""yes."" But the network's coverage of Trump and his campaign, which was dominated by conservative talk shows like The Five (which also aired on cable), hasn't changed much.","The answer to this question depends on how you define ""better."" The most common definition of a good story involves the following. It's not about what makes it great, but rather whether that person has done something in their life which they think will make them more successful at work and/or play an important role in society (e-mailing someone who works for your company). In other words…it doesn't matter if he likes his job well enough; there are some people out there with jobs where doing so would be considered acceptable by everyone else—and those folks aren' just as likely going into business because one day somebody says 'I'm gonna do my best.' That may sound like fun stuff when I say we're all pretty much equal here! But let me give another example from our own lives today...we've been living together since before Christmas time....We were married last year!! We had two kids - both very young children now!!!","The answer to this question has been a resounding ""yes."" In fact, the only thing that matters most about Trump's candidacy are his ratings. He hasn't won any national polls yet and he doesn' t have much of an edge over Hillary Clinton in either state (though she does seem like her best chance at winning).","The answer to this question depends on how you define ""better."" The best news story in the world, according a recent Gallup poll, has been MSNBC. And it's not just that there are more people who watch them than those watching cable TV (though they're still much less likely). It also seems like we've gotten used as little of an audience for our own shows and movies — which makes sense given what happened with Donald Trump last night when he was asked about his comments regarding women being treated unfairly by their employers during one interview after another at NBC News' headquarters.","The answer to that question was a resounding ""yes."" The network has been criticized for its coverage of the Benghazi attacks, which have left at least four Americans dead and more than 100 injured. But it's also seen as one of the most important news outlets in America — with an estimated $1 billion worth annually spent on advertising dollars covering nearly half of all U-S.-based cable TV shows airing across major networks nationwide (including MSNBC)."

He feeds them both the same food and they are very happy with it. The one that eats more often gets fat. So he gives it to his other rat. And then when she grows up she will give it back to him. But if you feed your rats different foods from time to time, they can get fat too. This happens because their bodies don't know what kind of diet works for them. They eat whatever they like. If you want to make sure that your animals stay healthy, try feeding them only healthy food. You should also keep an eye on how much sugar each animal eats. Sugar makes your pets sick. It causes diarrhea in some cases. Your pet may even die before its time. How many mice does it take to kill you? Mice are easy to kill. Just put poison inside a mouse trap and set it up. Then wait until morning and see how many mice there are. When night comes, go out and find all the dead mice.","The mouse has a much higher chance of being eaten by the rat, and so it will be more likely to survive. But if you want your cat to live longer, then you should get rid of all mice in your house. And that means getting rid of them all.

 Why Are Americans So Obese — Yet Not Europeans? : Shots - Health NewsObesity rates are rising among Americans, but not Europeans. Why?","The answer to this question depends on the type of mouse you have. If your mice are more active and have a higher metabolism, then they will be better at eating their way through food than rats do. However, if your mice are less active, but eat slower because they’re not as hungry, then they’ll do just fine. In fact, some studies suggest that even though rodents don’t like fast food, it may actually help them lose weight. To find out which kind of rodent would make for the best test subjects, researchers from the University of California, Davis, set up an experiment in which they fed two groups of mice. One group was given regular chow while the other got a diet containing only one ingredient: broccoli. They also gave each animal a small amount of either peanut butter or cheese. After three weeks, both groups had lost about 8 percent of their body weight, compared with those who ate normal food. But when scientists looked closely at how much weight these animals lost, they found something surprising: the mice whose diets were high in fat gained significantly more.","The mouse has a better chance of surviving and reproducing than the rat. Rats are more likely to be killed by predators like cats and dogs, while mice can survive for up to two years without being eaten by rodents. But if you want your pet to live longer and reproduce more, it makes sense to choose the mouse. So what do we know about mice? They have four legs instead of two. Their brains contain fewer neurons per cubic centimeter (neurons) than ours. And they don’t produce as much heat when they’re cold. Mice also seem to get less sick in cold weather compared with other animals. These differences between species may help explain why humans tend to die younger than mice. In fact, scientists think that our immune systems evolved from those of early mammals, which had shorter lifespans because their bodies were smaller and needed less food. That means we’re not so vulnerable to diseases such as colds and flu. Scientists still aren’t sure exactly how these differences affect health.","The answer to this question depends on the type of mouse you have. If it has a long tail, then yes, rats are better than mice. But if your mouse has short legs, and its tail is only about half as long, then mice will be better. Rats have longer legs which allow them to run faster while carrying their prey in front of them. Mice also carry more food so they can eat more. This means that for most animals, having both types of teeth would make no difference. However, some animals don't use either kind of tooth because they need one set of teeth to chew up food, but another set to grind down food. For example, dogs may have two sets of teeth, each with different functions. Dogs who have four incisors instead of three might prefer grinding meat rather than chewing. In other words, there could be an evolutionary advantage to using just one set. There are, however, exceptions to this. Some species like cats and dogs, which have five incisors, tend to use all five.","The first thing you need to know about the difference between a rodent and an animal, as well. A human has two legs (the front leg) while a dog's hindquarters are one foot long; both have three toes on each side of their body that can be used for walking in any direction but up-and down stairs at will! The second part of this question comes from how much weight your pet weighs when they're not moving around like humans do - it depends upon what kind of food/water source(s) he eats...","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The first thing that came up was the fact that rats are not actually rodents at all, they're just animals with their own bodies and brains (and sometimes even some other parts of themselves). They have different personalities based on how much energy it takes for them both to move around in space as well; there's no such difference between mice versus humans when you consider what kind people can do without being able see things through walls like eyesight!","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. The first attempt at using the term ""mouse"" was made in 2004 by David Lippmann, who had just published his book on mice and rats (Lipkin & Bockenheim 2002). He proposed that we should use an animal's brain as our guide for understanding how it behaves when interacting with other animals; he called these rodents'mice' because they were so different from humans but also due their ability of learning new things about themselves through social interaction rather than being taught what others thought them learned over years ago (""Mice are like monkeys,"" says Dr Jens Stoltenberg), which led to some interesting results such not only having more brains per unit area size compared against human beings – although there have even been studies showing similar differences between primates vs. non-human apes!","The answer to this question has been a long time coming, but it's finally here. The first version of the game was released in 2003 and since then we've seen many updates (including some that were not yet available).","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" If the rodent has a more complex brain, it's probably not going well. But if its brains are less complicated and have fewer neurons in them, then maybe that makes sense for rats as they're much easier than mice to learn how to use their bodies (or at least try). The same goes with rodents who don't need any special training but just want to be able do something useful like play video games – which can take years of practice before being used effectively enough so people get started quickly without having an entire day off from work!"

But you should know that harvard is: rules, differences.","I am a student at the University of Washington and have been following this story for some time. It seems that there are two schools in which students who want to get into Harvard must take an entrance exam on their first day there. The other school has no such requirement. This means that if you don't pass your exam, then you will be rejected from Harvard. Is it really worth it? If so, what should we do? There are many answers to this, but one thing that comes up time and again is that the admissions process does not work well when people can easily cheat it. In fact, cheating is so common among applicants that it’s become known as “test-cheating”. Most colleges don’t require any sort of test preparation before they accept applications. They just ask whether you’re good enough academically to go there, and that’s that. But most universities also expect you to submit essays about yourself – something that, by itself, would make me think twice about taking my chances with them.","I think the answer to this question depends on what you consider a “good” education. The Harvard and Princeton students who are going into business school will be better off than those from other schools. They have more time for their studies, they can take advantage of all kinds of opportunities that aren’t available at other schools, etc. But if you’re looking for an Ivy League education, you’ll probably want something like Stanford or MIT. If your goal is just to get out of debt as quickly as possible, then Harvard’s not so bad. It’s certainly worth it compared with some schools in New York City where tuition starts around $45,000 per year. I’m sure there are many people reading these comments who would disagree with my assessment of Harvard, but that’s okay. My point was simply that, given the choice, most people wouldn’t choose Harvard. And it’s not because they’re stupid. Most people don’t go to college because they love it. It doesn’t make them smarter, nor does it give them any extra advantages.","I have a friend who has been in the same program as me for over 10 years. He was accepted to both and chose Harvard. The reason he went with Harvard was because it had an excellent engineering program. It also offered him more opportunities than Princeton did. But then again, Princeton offers more opportunity than Harvard! So what do you think? Should we go with our friends at Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Penn, etc. Or should we choose another school? My son will be going into one of those schools this fall. We are looking forward to seeing how his experience there goes. However, my husband does not want us to send him there. As far as I’m concerned, that decision rests solely on him. If he chooses to go, that’s fine by me. But, if not, I’ll support whatever choice he makes. Hi there, 
 I am currently applying to several colleges including Princeton. I would like your opinion about which college best fits my son. I know that he wants to attend a top tier school but I don’t think it’s possible right now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","I am a student at the University of California Berkeley. My father was born in China and my mother from Taiwan. We are both Chinese Americans. In high school, we were not allowed to play sports because our parents thought it would be too “Asian.” They also didn’t want us going on dates with other Asian American students. This made me feel very uncomfortable as an Asian-American. But after graduation, they let me go out for dates. It wasn’t until college that I began dating white men. The first one who really understood me, he had been married twice before. He told me about his wife before me. When he found out, he said “I don’t know how you can do this to me.” That was it. After that, no more dating. How did your family react? My dad got angry when I dated someone outside of their race. And my mom started yelling at me saying she wanted her daughter to marry a white man. She said, “You can’t date another race if you’re Chinese.” So I stopped talking to her.","I am a high school senior and my parents are very wealthy. They have given me everything money can buy including the best education in the world. My family has always been extremely wealthy but they never had to work for it. We live in an area with good schools and we get all of our food from local farms. The only thing that could make this better would be if it were possible to move out here and start your own business. But since you can’t do that, then what makes us so special? Why should anyone want to come here? You say that people who don’t go to college will end up working at McDonald’s because there aren’t enough jobs here. This isn’t true. If someone went into business making burgers instead of being a teacher, he wouldn’t need to go to college. He just needs to learn how to cook them. And that’s exactly why many students don’t go to college, they won’t know anything about business, they’ll probably not even know how to cook.","The answer to this question depends on what you mean by ""better."" The best schools in the country are all good. Harvard, for example (which has a reputation as one of America's great universities), was founded and managed with an eye toward excellence from its founding fathers—the first president being William Henry Harrison who had been elected President at Princeton University after his father died; George Washington having served under him during World War II when he became Commander-in Chief). But it also happens that most other American colleges have some sort 'best' ranking system where they rank their students based upon how well each school does academically compared against others around them — which means there may be something about your college rankings relative only towards those institutions whose performance compares favorably between themselves versus another institution like Yale…or even worse …that doesn't really matter because if these things were true then maybe we'd see more people getting into higher education right now than ever before!","The answer to this question depends on which of the two schools you choose. In general, Harvard and Princeton are both excellent public universities with a reputation for excellence in their fields; but they have different academic standards than other private institutions (e-mail me if I'm wrong about that). The difference between these three colleges may be subtle—you might think it's because there aren't many students who can afford them all at once! But when we look closely at each institution individually, our results show us how much more important those differences really were before graduation from high school compared today. [1] If your college has been successful since grade 12 years ago, then what does ""success"" mean as far back into history as graduating fifth graders do now? It means getting an A+ rating by having done well academically during one year after being admitted[2].","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the last few years, many of us have come across articles and books that are written by people who know nothing about economics but want to learn more than they can chew on in their spare hours at home (and sometimes even work). I've read some great things from these authors; others were not so good either — like David Brooks's ""How To Get Rich Without A Job"" which was an excellent book for those with no background whatsoever!","The answer to this question depends on the context. The first part of that equation, which I'll explain below in a moment, comes from an article by David Sanger and his colleagues at Princeton University's Department Of Physics (the paper was published online last year). They found evidence for two distinct types — one based upon ""a simple but highly-accurate"" model with no known statistical significance; the other using more sophisticated methods such as random effects models where there are multiple possible outcomes like chance distributions between different groups within each group.) In their study they used data collected over several years during World War II through 1950s Germany under various conditions including war zones around Europe/North America etc.","The answer to this question has been a long time coming. In the late 1990s, I was invited by my friend and fellow Princeton graduate student Stephen Kornblum (who had recently graduated from Harvard) to write an article for The New York Times about how we should think of our colleges as ""the best in America."" He asked me if there were any other places that could be considered more prestigious than Cornell University—and he did! We all agreed on one thing; it's not just because they're great universities but also due largely at least partly through their alumni support networks like those provided under Title IX."

Other than that, it's great! This review is based on my experience with the Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. I've had mine since November 2013 and I'm still very happy with it. It's fast, easy to use, and reliable. My biggest complaint would be the lack of expandable storage. 32GB isn't enough space even though there are microSD slots. Also, if you're looking at buying this, make sure your device supports USB OTG.","I have a MacBook Air and an iPad Air. The Surface Pro 3 has the best display of them all. It also comes with better battery life than any other laptop I’ve ever used. And it can be used as a tablet. It’s not perfect, but it’s pretty close. If you want to use your tablet for work, then get a Windows 10 PC that runs Windows. You won’t find anything else that’s better. But if you’re going on vacation, you’ll need something lighter and more portable — like my iPad. So go ahead and buy one when they come out. You’ll thank me later. TL;DR Microsoft released its new Surface Laptop 2 this week, which will compete directly against Apple's latest model. Here's why it's worth it. How To Get Your Kids Involved In STEM Education 
 This post originally appeared at Entrepreneur.com. When we talk about education in America, we’re often talking about standardized tests and standardized curricula. We don’t really think much about how kids learn math and science by doing hands-on activities together.","Links What is better: iphone or laptop? I have a laptop and i love it. But the problem with it is, that when you are in an app like facebook, twitter, youtube, etc, they all take up so much space on your screen. So if you want to do something else, then you need to close them all. And this takes time away from what you’re doing. If you don’t mind this, than go for it… but be aware of this. I’m not sure how many people use their phones as computers these days, but my wife does. She has one phone, which she uses primarily for calling people, texting, etc. The other half of her day involves using social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., where she spends most of her time. This means that she’s constantly checking out new apps and websites while we’re at home, because we can’t always get online during our lunch break. When she gets home from work, she’ll usually check Facebook and/or Twitter before going back into work. It’s just part of being a busy mom.","The answer to this question depends on your situation. If you are using a smartphone, it may be best if the device has an integrated camera and/or microphone that can record video from any source (e-mailing) without having access by phone; however there will also always have been some need for additional microphones in case of emergency situations such as when someone needs help with their cell phones while they're out walking around town! Also note how many cameras do you use at home so I would suggest going down one size up but not too much because most people don't want them all over everything!! If we assume our current setup works well then what about those who already own smartphones??","The answer to this question depends on what you're looking for. If it's a smartphone, then there are many options available that will allow your phone and tablet device (and even the desktop) with its own camera system in place of an external one like Google Photos.","It's not really a question of whether you should buy an iPhone, but rather the fact that it has to be.","The answer to this question depends on your needs. If you're looking for a new phone, there are plenty of options available online and in stores that offer the same features as their competitors (such Aspire V2).","The answer to this question depends on your budget. If you're looking for a cheap, easy way to get started with the iPhone and iPad apps that are available in many stores around the world (and even if they aren't), then it's probably best not buy them at all!"
99,ps3,wii,"Everyone knows PS3 has better graphics than the Wii. And the PS3 does over the 360 and Wii. like ps3 and xbox 360 are powerful than wii!!!!
The ps3 is far better than the xbox or wii.
NZ: Wii is not as powerful as Xbox360 or PS3.

Wii U just isnt very much faster than PS3/360.The Wii U has MUCH sharper details over the PS3.Since the Wii U is stronger/better, than PS3&XBOX360.Wii U graphically weaker than 360/PS3, say devs . It is also important to notice that ps3 has such benefits as PS3's browser use is higher than Wii .I own a ps3... it's dustier than the wii.","After much thought, I realized that  wii is better, because: faster, sharper, stronger. But it will be useful for you to know that ps3 is: higher, dustier.","I have a Wii and the games are not that great. The graphics aren't as good either. But it has some really cool features like online play, netflix etc. And it's cheap. So if you don't care about graphics, then go for it. If you're looking to play games, get an Xbox 360 instead. This game looks awesome. I'm sure this will be one of my favorite games. It seems so much more fun than any other racing game. It's just too bad they didn't make it available on PS3 first. That would have been nice. Thanks for all your hard work guys. You guys rock! Can't wait until we can see what else you come up with. Keep up the great work! @10 - I think that's because there was no way to support multiplayer in the original Wii, but with the WII U there's still plenty of room for multiplayer. Also, since Nintendo owns the rights to Mario Kart 8 now, they'll probably release another version at some point down the line.","I have a Wii U and would like to get the same game on my PS4. Is there any way you can do that? Or should we wait for it to come out in Europe first? Thanks so much! @rjejr - The only difference between the two consoles is that the PS3 has an HDMI port whereas the Xbox One does not. If you're going to buy one of these consoles, make sure it's got an HDMI port. You won't be able to play games off your PC with it. This was already mentioned by another person but I'll add this as well. It seems Sony are trying to force people into buying their new console when they could just sell them old ones at a discount if they're not happy about having to pay full price again. It's really annoying how much money they've made from us over the years while making absolutely no effort to support us. They don't even give us free online multiplayer, which makes me wonder what other things they haven't bothered with.","I have a Wii U and the games are awesome. The graphics look great on my TV. But when it comes to playing games, there isn’t much difference between the two systems. Maybe it’s because of how they were designed for each other. If you want to play some good old Nintendo 64 games, then go with Nintendo. They make amazing games. And if you’re looking for something new, try out Xbox One. It’s got tons of cool titles coming out. You can also get your hands on some awesome new consoles like PS4 and X1. Just remember that all these systems will be released in 2014 so you’ll need to wait until then. Good luck everyone! @rjejr – I’m not sure what your point is. It seems pretty clear from the article that this was an attempt at making the console more appealing to younger gamers. This could very well mean that Sony has decided to release their own handheld gaming system instead of just releasing one as well.","I have a Wii U and the games are better on it than they were on my PS3. The graphics look better, sound quality sounds better. It also has more games. But if you want to play some of your favorite games, then get an Xbox One. You can do that with any console but not all at once. If you buy one game every month, you’ll be able to play them all. And there will always be new titles coming out for it. So what about games? Well it’s hard to say because most people don’t like Nintendo as much anymore. They just seem to make bad decisions now and then. That being said, Mario Kart 8 was pretty good. There wasn’t anything wrong with it, except maybe that it didn’t really feel like a Mario game. Maybe that’s why so many people hated it? It’s still fun though. Just doesn’t hold up against other Mario titles.","I have a Wii and it works great. The only thing that sucks about the Wii, is that you can’t play games like Super Mario Galaxy, which are on my PS3 now. But other than that, it’s awesome. And if you’re going to buy one of these systems, get the Wii. It’s worth it. My son has an Xbox 360 but he doesn’t use it as much because he’s not really into gaming. He does watch movies though so maybe that’s why he hasn’t played with his system much. If your kids don’t care for gaming, then they should probably go with the PS3. You can also find some great deals at Best Buy right now too. I’m 13 years old and i love video games. I own both systems (ps2 & xbox) and i think they’re pretty cool. They all work fine except for the fact that the wii u doesnt support online multiplayer. That was kind of disappointing since its supposed to. Other than that though, this game looks amazing.","I'm not sure. I think it's a good idea to have the game on your PC, but if you're using Windows 7 and don't want to play with other people then go for that one instead of going through this whole process again (or maybe just use an emulator).","The best way to play the game on a PC, at least for me. I'm not sure if it's worth playing with my friends but i've played most of them and they are pretty good games so far (I don't know how many people have tried this).","The best thing about the PS4 and Wii U versions of The Legend Of Zelda series, at least for me personally. I'm not sure if it's because they're all so different but as a gamer you can't really complain when something feels like an absolute masterpiece in its own right (or even just plain awful).","I'm not sure what to say, but I think it's a good idea. The game has been on my mind for quite some time now and the fact that this was released in Japan means there are plenty of people who would love something like PS4/Wiii with all these new features (and maybe even more).","A. The best way to play the game on a PS4 and Xbox One, with all of its features including online multiplayer (PSN), will be through PC/Mac games like Super Smash Bros., Donkey Kong Country Returns, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Pikmin 3D World 2, etc."
